<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">John Keble</span>, two years older than
his friend Dr. Arnold of Rugby, three years older than Thomas
Carlyle, and nine years older than John Henry Newman, was born in
1792, at Fairford in Gloucestershire.&nbsp; He was born in his
father&rsquo;s parsonage, and educated at home by his father till
he went to college.&nbsp; His father then entered him at his own
college at Oxford, Corpus Christi.&nbsp; Thoroughly trained,
Keble obtained high reputation at his University for character
and scholarship, and became a Fellow of Oriel.&nbsp; After some
years he gave up work in the University, though he could not
divest himself of a large influence there for good, returned home
to his old father, who required help in his ministry, and
undertook for his the duty of two little curacies.&nbsp; The
father lived on to the age of ninety.&nbsp; John Keble&rsquo;s
love for God and his devotion to the Church had often been
expressed in verse.&nbsp; On days which the Church specially
celebrated, he had from time to time written short poems to utter
from the heart his own devout sense of their spiritual use and
meaning.&nbsp; As the number of these poems increased, the desire
rose to follow in like manner the while course of the Christian
Year as it was marked for the people by the sequence of church
services, which had been arranged to bring in due order before
the minds of Christian worshippers all the foundations of their
faith, and all the elements of a religious life.&nbsp; A book of
poems, breathing faith and worship at all points, and in all
attitudes of heavenward contemplation, within the circle of the
Christian Year, would, he hoped, restore in many minds to many a
benumbed form life and energy.</p>
<p>In 1825, while the poems of the Christian Year were gradually
being shaped into a single work, a brother became able to relieve
John Keble in that pious care for which his father had drawn him
away from a great University career, and he then went to a curacy
at Hursley, four or five miles from Winchester.</p>
<p>In 1827&mdash;when its author&rsquo;s age was
thirty-five&mdash;&ldquo;The Christian Year&rdquo; was
published.&nbsp; Like George Herbert, whose equal he was in piety
though not in power, Keble was joined to the Church in fullest
sympathy with all its ordinances, and desired to quicken worship
by putting into each part of the ritual a life that might pass
into and raise the life of man.&nbsp; The spirit of true
religion, with a power beyond that of any earthly feuds and
controversies, binds together those in whom it really
lives.&nbsp; Setting aside all smaller questions of the relative
value of different earthly means to the attainment of a life
hidden with Christ in God, Christians of all forms who are one in
spirit have found help from &ldquo;John Keble&rsquo;s Christian
Year,&rdquo; and think of its guileless author with kindly
affection.&nbsp; Within five-and-twenty years of its publication,
a hundred thousand copies had been sold.&nbsp; The book is still
diffused so widely, in editions of all forms, that it may yet go
on, until the circle of the years shall be no more, living and
making live.</p>
<p>Four years after &ldquo;The Christian Year&rdquo; appeared,
Keble was appointed (in 1831) to the usual five years&rsquo;
tenure of the Poetry Professorship at Oxford.&nbsp; Two years
after he had been appointed Poetry Professor, he preached the
Assize Sermon, and took for his theme &ldquo;National
Apostasy.&rdquo;&nbsp; John Henry Newman, who had obtained his
Fellowship at Oriel some years before the publication of
&ldquo;The Christian Year,&rdquo; and was twenty-six years old
when it appeared, received from it a strong impulse towards the
endeavour to revive the spirit of the Church by restoring life
and soul to all her ordinances, and even to the minutest detail
of her ritual.&nbsp; The deep respect felt for the author of
&ldquo;The Christian Year&rdquo; gave power to the sermon of 1833
upon National Apostasy, and made it the starting-point of the
Oxford movement known as Tractarian, from the issue of tracts
through which its promoters sought to stir life in the clergy and
the people; known also as Puseyite because it received help at
the end of the year 1833 from Dr. Pusey, who was of like age with
J. H. Newman, and then Regius Professor of Hebrew.&nbsp; There
was a danger, which some then foresaw, in the nature of this
endeavour to put life into the Church; but we all now recognise
the purity of Christian zeal that prompted the attempt to make
dead forms of ceremonial glow again with spiritual fire, and
serve as aids to the recovery of light and warmth in our
devotions.</p>
<p>It was in 1833 that Keble, by one earnest sermon, with a pure
life at the back of it, and this book that had prepared the way,
gave the direct impulse to an Oxford movement for the reformation
of the Church.&nbsp; The movement then began.&nbsp; But Keble
went back to his curacy at Hursley.&nbsp; Two years afterwards
the curate became vicar, and then Keble married.&nbsp; His
after-life continued innocent and happy.&nbsp; He and his wife
died within two months of each other, in the came year,
1866.&nbsp; He had taken part with his friends at Oxford by
writing five of their Tracts, publishing a few sermons that
laboured towards the same end, and editing a &ldquo;Library of
the Fathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1847 he produced another volume of
poems, &ldquo;Lyra Innocentium,&rdquo; which associated doctrines
of the Church with the lives of children, whom he loved, though
his own marriage was childless.</p>
<p>The power of Keble&rsquo;s verse lies in its truth.&nbsp; A
faithful and pure nature, strong in home affections, full of love
and reverence for all that is of heaven in our earthly lot,
strives for the full consecration of man&rsquo;s life with love
and faith.&nbsp; There is no rare gift of genius.&nbsp; Keble is
not in subtlety of thought or of expression another George
Herbert, or another Henry Vaughan.&nbsp; But his voice is not the
less in unison with theirs, for every note is true, and wins us
by its purity.&nbsp; His also are melodies of the everlasting
chime.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And be
ye sure that Love can bless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en in this crowded
loneliness,<br />
Where ever moving myriads seem to say,<br />
Go&mdash;thou art nought to us, nor we to
thee&mdash;away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are in this loud stunning tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of human care and crime,<br />
With whom the melodies abide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the everlasting chime;<br />
Who carry music in their heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through dusky lane and wrangling mart,<br />
Plying their daily task with busier feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because their secret souls a holy strain
repeat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a peal, then, of such music let us ring in the New Year
for our Library; and for our lives.</p>

<h2>DEDICATION.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> in my silent
solitary walk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I sought a strain not all unworthy Thee,<br />
My heart, still ringing with wild worldly talk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gave forth no note of holier minstrelsy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Prayer is the secret, to myself I said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong supplication must call down the charm,<br />
And thus with untuned heart I feebly prayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Knocking at Heaven&rsquo;s gate with earth-palsied
arm.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fountain of Harmony!&nbsp; Thou Spirit
blest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By whom the troubled waves of earthly sound<br />
Are gathered into order, such as best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some high-souled bard in his enchanted round</p>
<p class="poetry">May compass, Power divine!&nbsp; Oh, spread Thy
wing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy dovelike wing that makes confusion fly,<br />
Over my dark, void spirit, summoning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; New worlds of music, strains that may not die.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, happiest who before thine altar wait,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With pure hands ever holding up on high<br />
The guiding Star of all who seek Thy gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The undying lamp of heavenly Poesy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Too weak, too wavering, for such holy task<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is my frail arm, O Lord; but I would fain<br />
Track to its source the brightness, I would bask<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the clear ray that makes Thy pathway plain.</p>
<p class="poetry">I dare not hope with David&rsquo;s harp to
chase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The evil spirit from the troubled breast;<br />
Enough for me if I can find such grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To listen to the strain, and be at rest.</p>
<h2>THE CHRISTIAN YEAR.</h2>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Morning.</h3>
<blockquote><p>His compassions fail not.&nbsp; They are new every
morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Lament</i>. iii. 22, 23.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Hues</span> of the rich
unfolding morn,<br />
That, ere the glorious sun be born,<br />
By some soft touch invisible<br />
Around his path are taught to swell;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou rustling breeze so fresh and gay,<br />
That dancest forth at opening day,<br />
And brushing by with joyous wing,<br />
Wakenest each little leaf to sing;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye fragrant clouds of dewy steam,<br />
By which deep grove and tangled stream<br />
Pay, for soft rains in season given,<br />
Their tribute to the genial heaven;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Why waste your treasures of delight<br />
Upon our thankless, joyless sight;<br />
Who day by day to sin awake,<br />
Seldom of Heaven and you partake?</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, timely happy, timely wise,<br />
Hearts that with rising morn arise!<br />
Eyes that the beam celestial view,<br />
Which evermore makes all things new!</p>
<p class="poetry">New every morning is the love<br />
Our wakening and uprising prove;<br />
Through sleep and darkness safely brought,<br />
Restored to life, and power, and thought.</p>
<p class="poetry">New mercies, each returning day,<br />
Hover around us while we pray;<br />
New perils past, new sins forgiven,<br />
New thoughts of God, new hopes of Heaven.</p>
<p class="poetry">If on our daily course our mind<br />
Be set to hallow all we find,<br />
New treasures still, of countless price,<br />
God will provide for sacrifice.</p>
<p class="poetry">Old friends, old scenes will lovelier be,<br />
As more of Heaven in each we see:<br />
Some softening gleam of love and prayer<br />
Shall dawn on every cross and care.</p>
<p class="poetry">As for some dear familiar strain<br />
Untired we ask, and ask again,<br />
Ever, in its melodious store,<br />
Finding a spell unheard before;</p>
<p class="poetry">Such is the bliss of souls serene,<br />
When they have sworn, and stedfast mean,<br />
Counting the cost, in all t&rsquo; espy<br />
Their God, in all themselves deny.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, could we learn that sacrifice,<br />
What lights would all around us rise!<br />
How would our hearts with wisdom talk<br />
Along Life&rsquo;s dullest, dreariest walk!</p>
<p class="poetry">We need not bid, for cloistered cell,<br />
Our neighbour and our work farewell,<br />
Nor strive to wind ourselves too high<br />
For sinful man beneath the sky:</p>
<p class="poetry">The trivial round, the common task,<br />
Would furnish all we ought to ask;<br />
Room to deny ourselves; a road<br />
To bring us daily nearer God.</p>
<p class="poetry">Seek we no more; content with these,<br />
Let present Rapture, Comfort, Ease,<br />
As Heaven shall bid them, come and go:&mdash;<br />
The secret this of Rest below.</p>
<p class="poetry">Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love<br />
Fit us for perfect Rest above;<br />
And help us, this and every day,<br />
To live more nearly as we pray.</p>
<h3>Evening.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the
day is far spent.&mdash;<i>St. Luke</i> xxiv. 29.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Tis</span> gone,
that bright and orb&egrave;d blaze,<br />
Fast fading from our wistful gaze;<br />
You mantling cloud has hid from sight<br />
The last faint pulse of quivering light.</p>
<p class="poetry">In darkness and in weariness<br />
The traveller on his way must press,<br />
No gleam to watch on tree or tower,<br />
Whiling away the lonesome hour.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sun of my soul!&nbsp; Thou Saviour dear,<br />
It is not night if Thou be near:<br />
Oh, may no earth-born cloud arise<br />
To hide Thee from Thy servant&rsquo;s eyes!</p>
<p class="poetry">When round Thy wondrous works below<br />
My searching rapturous glance I throw,<br />
Tracing out Wisdom, Power and Love,<br />
In earth or sky, in stream or grove;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Or by the light Thy words disclose<br />
Watch Time&rsquo;s full river as it flows,<br />
Scanning Thy gracious Providence,<br />
Where not too deep for mortal sense:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">When with dear friends sweet talk I hold,<br />
And all the flowers of life unfold;<br />
Let not my heart within me burn,<br />
Except in all I Thee discern.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the soft dews of kindly sleep<br />
My wearied eyelids gently steep,<br />
Be my last thought, how sweet to rest<br />
For ever on my Saviour&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p class="poetry">Abide with me from morn till eve,<br />
For without Thee I cannot live:<br />
Abide with me when night is nigh,<br />
For without Thee I dare not die.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou Framer of the light and dark,<br />
Steer through the tempest Thine own ark:<br />
Amid the howling wintry sea<br />
We are in port if we have Thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Rulers of this Christian land,<br />
&rsquo;Twixt Thee and us ordained to stand,&mdash;<br />
Guide Thou their course, O Lord, aright,<br />
Let all do all as in Thy sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! by Thine own sad burthen, borne<br />
So meekly up the hill of scorn,<br />
Teach Thou Thy Priests their daily cross<br />
To bear as Thine, nor count it loss!</p>
<p class="poetry">If some poor wandering child of Thine<br />
Have spurned to-day the voice divine,<br />
Now, Lord, the gracious work begin;<br />
Let him no more lie down in sin.</p>
<p class="poetry">Watch by the sick: enrich the poor<br />
With blessings from Thy boundless store:<br />
Be every mourner&rsquo;s sleep to-night,<br />
Like infants&rsquo; slumbers, pure and light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come near and bless us when we wake,<br />
Ere through the world our way we take;<br />
Till in the ocean of Thy love<br />
We lose ourselves, in Heaven above.</p>
<h3>Advent Sunday.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now
is our salvation nearer than when we
believed.&mdash;<i>Romans</i> xiii 11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Awake</span>&mdash;again
the Gospel-trump is blown&mdash;<br />
From year to year it swells with louder tone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From year to year the signs of wrath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are gathering round the Judge&rsquo;s path,<br />
Strange words fulfilled, and mighty works achieved,<br />
And truth in all the world both hated and believed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Awake! why linger in the gorgeous town,<br />
Sworn liegemen of the Cross and thorny crown?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up from your beds of sloth for shame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speed to the eastern mount like flame,<br />
Nor wonder, should ye find your King in tears,<br />
E&rsquo;en with the loud Hosanna ringing in His ears.</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas! no need to rouse them: long ago<br />
They are gone forth to swell Messiah&rsquo;s show:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With glittering robes and garlands sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They strew the ground beneath His feet:<br />
All but your hearts are there&mdash;O doomed to prove<br />
The arrows winged in Heaven for Faith that will not love!</p>
<p class="poetry">Meanwhile He passes through th&rsquo; adoring
crowd,<br />
Calm as the march of some majestic cloud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That o&rsquo;er wild scenes of ocean-war<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Holds its still course in Heaven afar:<br />
E&rsquo;en so, heart-searching Lord, as years roll on,<br />
Thou keepest silent watch from Thy triumphal throne:</p>
<p class="poetry">E&rsquo;en so, the world is thronging round to
gaze<br />
On the dread vision of the latter days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Constrained to own Thee, but in heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepared to take Barabbas&rsquo; part:<br />
&ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; now, to-morrow &ldquo;Crucify,&rdquo;<br />
The changeful burden still of their rude lawless cry.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet in that throng of selfish hearts untrue<br
/>
Thy sad eye rests upon Thy faithful few,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Children and childlike souls are there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blind Bartimeus&rsquo; humble prayer,<br />
And Lazarus wakened from his four days&rsquo; sleep,<br />
Enduring life again, that Passover to keep.</p>
<p class="poetry">And fast beside the olive-bordered way<br />
Stands the blessed home where Jesus deigned to stay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The peaceful home, to Zeal sincere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And heavenly Contemplation dear,<br />
Where Martha loved to wait with reverence meet,<br />
And wiser Mary lingered at Thy sacred feet.</p>
<p class="poetry">Still through decaying ages as they glide,<br
/>
Thou lov&rsquo;st Thy chosen remnant to divide;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sprinkled along the waste of years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full many a soft green isle appears:<br />
Pause where we may upon the desert road,<br />
Some shelter is in sight, some sacred safe abode.</p>
<p class="poetry">When withering blasts of error swept the
sky,<br />
And Love&rsquo;s last flower seemed fain to droop and die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How sweet, how lone the ray benign<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On sheltered nooks of Palestine!<br />
Then to his early home did Love repair,<br />
And cheered his sickening heart with his own native air.</p>
<p class="poetry">Years roll away: again the tide of crime<br />
Has swept Thy footsteps from the favoured clime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where shall the holy Cross find rest?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a crowned monarch&rsquo;s mail&egrave;d
breast:<br />
Like some bright angel o&rsquo;er the darkling scene,<br />
Through court and camp he holds his heavenward course serene.</p>
<p class="poetry">A fouler vision yet; an age of light,<br />
Light without love, glares on the aching sight:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, who can tell how calm and sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Meek Walton, shows thy green retreat,<br />
When wearied with the tale thy times disclose,<br />
The eye first finds thee out in thy secure repose?</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus bad and good their several warnings
give<br />
Of His approach, whom none may see and live:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith&rsquo;s ear, with awful still delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Counts them like minute-bells at night.<br />
Keeping the heart awake till dawn of morn,<br />
While to her funeral pile this aged world is borne.</p>
<p class="poetry">But what are Heaven&rsquo;s alarms to hearts
that cower<br />
In wilful slumber, deepening every hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That draw their curtains closer round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The nearer swells the trumpet&rsquo;s sound?<br />
Lord, ere our trembling lamps sink down and die,<br />
Touch us with chastening hand, and make us feel Thee nigh.</p>
<h3>Second Sunday in Advent.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And when these things begin to pass, then look up,
and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth night.&nbsp;
<i>St. Luke</i> xxi. 28.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Not</span> till the
freezing blast is still,<br />
Till freely leaps the sparkling rill,<br />
And gales sweep soft from summer skies,<br />
As o&rsquo;er a sleeping infant&rsquo;s eyes<br />
A mother&rsquo;s kiss; ere calls like these,<br />
No sunny gleam awakes the trees,<br />
Nor dare the tender flowerets show<br />
Their bosoms to th&rsquo; uncertain glow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Why then, in sad and wintry time,<br />
Her heavens all dark with doubt and crime,<br />
Why lifts the Church her drooping head,<br />
As though her evil hour were fled?<br />
Is she less wise than leaves of spring,<br />
Or birds that cower with folded wing?<br />
What sees she in this lowering sky<br />
To tempt her meditative eye?</p>
<p class="poetry">She has a charm, a word of fire,<br />
A pledge of love that cannot tire;<br />
By tempests, earthquakes, and by wars,<br />
By rushing waves and falling stars,<br />
By every sign her Lord foretold,<br />
She sees the world is waxing old,<br />
And through that last and direst storm<br />
Descries by faith her Saviour&rsquo;s form.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not surer does each tender gem,<br />
Set in the fig-tree&rsquo;s polish&rsquo;d stem,<br />
Foreshow the summer season bland,<br />
Than these dread signs Thy mighty hand:<br />
But, oh, frail hearts, and spirits dark!<br />
The season&rsquo;s flight unwarn&rsquo;d we mark,<br />
But miss the Judge behind the door,<br />
For all the light of sacred lore:</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet is He there; beneath our eaves<br />
Each sound His wakeful ear receives:<br />
Hush, idle words, and thoughts of ill,<br />
Your Lord is listening: peace, be still.<br />
Christ watches by a Christian&rsquo;s hearth,<br />
Be silent, &ldquo;vain deluding mirth,&rdquo;<br />
Till in thine alter&rsquo;d voice be known<br />
Somewhat of Resignation&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p class="poetry">But chiefly ye should lift your gaze<br />
Above the world&rsquo;s uncertain haze,<br />
And look with calm unwavering eye<br />
On the bright fields beyond the sky,<br />
Ye, who your Lord&rsquo;s commission bear<br />
His way of mercy to prepare:<br />
Angels He calls ye: be your strife<br />
To lead on earth an Angel&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p class="poetry">Think not of rest; though dreams be sweet,<br
/>
Start up, and ply your heavenward feet.<br />
Is not God&rsquo;s oath upon your head,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er to sink back on slothful bed,<br />
Never again your loans untie,<br />
Nor let your torches waste and die,<br />
Till, when the shadows thickest fall,<br />
Ye hear your Master&rsquo;s midnight call?</p>
<h3>Third Sunday in Advent.</h3>
<blockquote><p>What went ye out into the wilderness to see?&nbsp;
A reed shaken with the wind? . . . But what went ye out for to
see?&nbsp; A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a
prophet.&nbsp; <i>St. Matthew</i> xi. 7, 9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">What</span> went ye out to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the rude sandy lea,<br />
Where stately Jordan flows by many a palm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or where Gennesaret&rsquo;s wave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Delights the flowers to lave,<br />
That o&rsquo;er her western slope breathe airs of balm.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All through the summer
night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those blossoms red and bright<br />
Spread their soft breasts, unheeding, to the breeze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like hermits watching still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the sacred hill,<br />
Where erst our Saviour watched upon His knees.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paschal moon above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems like a saint to rove,<br />
Left shining in the world with Christ alone;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Below, the lake&rsquo;s still face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleeps sweetly in th&rsquo; embrace<br />
Of mountains terrac&rsquo;d high with mossy stone.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here may we sit, and dream<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the heavenly theme,<br />
Till to our soul the former days return;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till on the grassy bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where thousands once He fed,<br />
The world&rsquo;s incarnate Maker we discern.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O cross no more the main,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wandering so will and vain,<br />
To count the reeds that tremble in the wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On listless dalliance bound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like children gazing round,<br />
Who on God&rsquo;s works no seal of Godhead find.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bask not in courtly bower,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or sun-bright hall of power,<br />
Pass Babel quick, and seek the holy land&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From robes of Tyrian dye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn with undazzled eye<br />
To Bethlehem&rsquo;s glade, or Carmel&rsquo;s haunted strand.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or choose thee out a cell<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Kedron&rsquo;s storied dell,<br />
Beside the springs of Love, that never die;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the olives kneel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The chill night-blast to feel,<br />
And watch the Moon that saw thy Master&rsquo;s agony.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rise at dawn of day,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wind thy thoughtful way,<br />
Where rested once the Temple&rsquo;s stately shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With due feet tracing round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The city&rsquo;s northern bound,<br />
To th&rsquo; other holy garden, where the Lord was laid.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thus alternate see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His death and victory,<br />
Rising and falling as on angel wings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They, while they seem to roam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Draw daily nearer home,<br />
Their heart untravell&rsquo;d still adores the King of kings.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if at home they stay,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet are they, day by day,<br />
In spirit journeying through the glorious land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not for light Fancy&rsquo;s reed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor Honour&rsquo;s purple meed,<br />
Nor gifted Prophet&rsquo;s lore, nor Science&rsquo; wondrous
wand.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more than Prophet,
more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than Angels can adore<br />
With face unveiled, is He they go to seek:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bless&egrave;d be God, Whose grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shows Him in every place<br />
To homeliest hearts of pilgrims pure and meek.</p>
<h3>Fourth Sunday in Advent.</h3>
<blockquote><p>The eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and
the ears of them that hear shall hearken.&nbsp; <i>Isaiah</i>
xxxii. 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Of</span> the bright things
in earth and air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How little can the heart embrace!<br />
Soft shades and gleaming lights are there&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I know it well, but cannot trace.</p>
<p class="poetry">Mine eye unworthy seems to read<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One page of Nature&rsquo;s beauteous book;<br />
It lies before me, fair outspread&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I only cast a wishful look.</p>
<p class="poetry">I cannot paint to Memory&rsquo;s eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene, the glance, I dearest love&mdash;<br />
Unchanged themselves, in me they die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or faint or false their shadows prove.</p>
<p class="poetry">In vain, with dull and tuneless ear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I linger by soft Music&rsquo;s cell,<br />
And in my heart of hearts would hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What to her own she deigns to tell.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis misty all, both sight and
sound&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I only know &rsquo;tis fair and sweet&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis wandering on enchanted ground<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With dizzy brow and tottering feet.</p>
<p class="poetry">But patience! there may come a time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When these dull ears shall scan aright<br />
Strains that outring Earth&rsquo;s drowsy chime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As Heaven outshines the taper&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p class="poetry">These eyes, that dazzled now and weak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At glancing motes in sunshine wink.<br />
Shall see the Kings full glory break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor from the blissful vision shrink:</p>
<p class="poetry">In fearless love and hope uncloyed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever on that ocean bright<br />
Empowered to gaze; and undestroyed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeper and deeper plunge in light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though scarcely now their laggard glance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reach to an arrow&rsquo;s flight, that day<br />
They shall behold, and not in trance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The region &ldquo;very far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">If Memory sometimes at our spell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Refuse to speak, or speak amiss,<br />
We shall not need her where we dwell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever in sight of all our bliss.</p>
<p class="poetry">Meanwhile, if over sea or sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some tender lights unnoticed fleet,<br />
Or on loved features dawn and die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unread, to us, their lesson sweet;</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet are there saddening sights around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which Heaven, in mercy, spares us too,<br />
And we see far in holy ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If duly purged our mental view.</p>
<p class="poetry">The distant landscape draws not nigh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all our gazing; but the soul,<br />
That upward looks, may still descry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearer, each day, the brightening goal.</p>
<p class="poetry">And thou, too curious ear, that fain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wouldst thread the maze of Harmony,<br />
Content thee with one simple strain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lowlier, sure, the worthier thee;</p>
<p class="poetry">Till thou art duly trained, and taught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The concord sweet of Love divine:<br />
Then, with that inward Music fraught,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever rise, and sing, and shine.</p>
<h3>Christmas Day.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude
of the heavenly host, praising God.&nbsp; <i>St. Luke</i> ii.
13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">What</span> sudden blaze of song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spreads
o&rsquo;er th&rsquo; expanse of Heaven?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In waves of light it thrills along,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Th&rsquo;
angelic signal given&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Glory to God!&rdquo; from yonder central
fire<br />
Flows out the echoing lay beyond the starry choir;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
circles widening round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon a clear
blue river,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orb after orb, the wondrous sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is echoed on for
ever:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Glory to God on high, on earth be peace,<br
/>
And love towards men of love&mdash;salvation and
release.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet stay,
before thou dare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To join that
festal throng;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen and mark what gentle air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First stirred
the tide of song;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not, &ldquo;the Saviour born in
David&rsquo;s home,<br />
To Whom for power and health obedient worlds should
come:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis
not, &ldquo;the Christ the Lord:&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With fixed
adoring look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The choir of Angels caught the word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor yet their
silence broke:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But when they heard the sign where Christ should
be,<br />
In sudden light they shone and heavenly harmony.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in
His swaddling bands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in His
manger laid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hope and Glory of all lands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is come to the
world&rsquo;s aid:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No peaceful home upon his cradle smiled,<br />
Guests rudely went and came, where slept the royal Child.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where
Thou dwellest, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No other thought
should be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once duly welcomed and adored,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How should I
part with Thee?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bethlehem must lose Thee soon, but Thou wilt
grace<br />
The single heart to be Thy sure abiding-place.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee, on
the bosom laid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a pure virgin
mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In quiet ever, and in shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shepherd and
sage may find;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They, who have bowed untaught to Nature&rsquo;s
sway,<br />
And they, who follow Truth along her star-paved way.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
pastoral spirits first<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approach Thee,
Babe divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For they in lowly thoughts are nursed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet for Thy
lowly shrine:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sooner than they should miss where Thou dost
dwell,<br />
Angela from Heaven will stoop to guide them to Thy cell.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, as
the day comes round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Thee to be
revealed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By wakeful shepherds Thou art found,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abiding in the
field.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All through the wintry heaven and chill night
air,<br />
In music and in light Thou dawnest on their prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O faint not
ye for fear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What though your
wandering sheep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reckless of what they see and hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lie lost in
wilful sleep?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High Heaven in mercy to your sad annoy<br />
Still greets you with glad tidings of immortal joy.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think on
th&rsquo; eternal home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Saviour left
for you;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Think on the Lord most holy, come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To dwell with
hearts untrue:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So shall ye tread untired His pastoral ways,<br />
And in the darkness sing your carol of high praise.</p>
<h3>St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day.</h3>
<blockquote><p>He, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up
steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus
standing on the right hand of God.&nbsp; <i>Acts</i> vii. 55</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">As</span> rays around the
source of light<br />
Stream upward ere he glow in sight,<br />
And watching by his future flight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the clear heavens on fire;<br />
So on the King of Martyrs wait<br />
Three chosen bands, in royal state,<br />
And all earth owns, of good and great,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is gather&rsquo;d in that choir.</p>
<p class="poetry">One presses on, and welcomes death:<br />
One calmly yields his willing breath,<br />
Nor slow, nor hurrying, but in faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Content to die or live:<br />
And some, the darlings of their Lord,<br />
Play smiling with the flame and sword,<br />
And, ere they speak, to His sure word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unconscious witness give.</p>
<p class="poetry">Foremost and nearest to His throne,<br />
By perfect robes of triumph known,<br />
And likest Him in look and tone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The holy Stephen kneels,<br />
With stedfast gaze, as when the sky<br />
Flew open to his fainting eye,<br />
Which, like a fading lamp, flash&rsquo;d high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing what death conceals.</p>
<p class="poetry">Well might you guess what vision bright<br />
Was present to his raptured sight,<br />
E&rsquo;en as reflected streams of light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their solar source betray&mdash;<br />
The glory which our God surrounds,<br />
The Son of Man, the atoning wounds&mdash;<br />
He sees them all; and earth&rsquo;s dull bounds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are melting fast away.</p>
<p class="poetry">He sees them all&mdash;no other view<br />
Could stamp the Saviour&rsquo;s likeness true,<br />
Or with His love so deep embrue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s sullen heart and gross&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Jesus, do Thou my soul receive:<br />
Jesu, do Thou my foes forgive;&rdquo;<br />
He who would learn that prayer must live<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the holy Cross.</p>
<p class="poetry">He, though he seem on earth to move,<br />
Must glide in air like gentle dove,<br />
From yon unclouded depths above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must draw his purer breath;<br />
Till men behold his angel face<br />
All radiant with celestial grace,<br />
Martyr all o&rsquo;er, and meet to trace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lines of Jesus&rsquo; death.</p>
<h3>St. John&rsquo;s Day.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what
shall this man do?&nbsp; Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he
tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou Me.&nbsp;
<i>St. John</i> xxi. 21, 22.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
what shall this man do?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask&rsquo;st thou, Christian, for thy friend?<br />
If his love for Christ be true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ hath told thee of his end:<br />
This is he whom God approves,<br />
This is he whom Jesus loves.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ask not of him more than this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave it in his Saviour&rsquo;s breast,<br />
Whether, early called to bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He in youth shall find his rest,<br />
Or arm&egrave;d in his station wait<br />
Till his Lord be at the gate:</p>
<p class="poetry">Whether in his lonely course<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Lonely, not forlorn) he stay,<br />
Or with Love&rsquo;s supporting force<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheat the toil, and cheer the way:<br />
Leave it all in His high hand,<br />
Who doth hearts as streams command.</p>
<p class="poetry">Gales from Heaven, if so He will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweeter melodies can wake<br />
On the lonely mountain rill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the meeting waters make.<br />
Who hath the Father and the Son,<br />
May be left, but not alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sick or healthful, slave or free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wealthy, or despised and poor&mdash;<br />
What is that to him or thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So his love to Christ endure?<br />
When the shore is won at last,<br />
Who will count the billows past?</p>
<p class="poetry">Only, since our souls will shrink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the touch of natural grief,<br />
When our earthly loved ones sink,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lend us, Lord, Thy sure relief;<br />
Patient hearts, their pain to see,<br />
And Thy grace, to follow Thee.</p>
<h3>The Holy Innocents.</h3>
<blockquote><p>These were redeemed from among men, being the
firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.&nbsp; <i>Rev.</i> xiv.
4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Say</span>, ye celestial guards, who wait<br />
In Bethlehem, round the Saviour&rsquo;s palace gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, who are these on golden wings,<br />
That hover o&rsquo;er the new-born King of kings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their palms and garlands telling plain<br />
That they are of the glorious martyr-train,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to yourselves ordained to praise<br />
His Name, and brighten as on Him they gaze?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where their spoils and
trophies? where<br />
The glorious dint a martyr&rsquo;s shield should bear?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How chance no cheek among them wears<br />
The deep-worn trace of penitential tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But all is bright and smiling love,<br />
As if, fresh-borne from Eden&rsquo;s happy grove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They had flown here, their King to see,<br />
Nor ever had been heirs of dark mortality?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask, and some angel will
reply,<br />
&ldquo;These, like yourselves, were born to sin and die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But ere the poison root was grown,<br />
God set His seal, and marked them for His own.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Baptised its blood for Jesus&rsquo; sake,<br />
Now underneath the Cross their bed they make,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to be scared from that sure rest<br />
By frightened mother&rsquo;s shriek, or warrior&rsquo;s waving
crest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindful of these, the
firstfruits sweet<br />
Borne by this suffering Church her Lord to greet;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blessed Jesus ever loved to trace<br />
The &ldquo;innocent brightness&rdquo; of an infant&rsquo;s
face.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He raised them in His holy arms,<br />
He blessed them from the world and all its harms:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heirs though they were of sin and shame,<br />
He blessed them in his own and in his Father&rsquo;s Name.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as each fond
unconscious child<br />
On the everlasting Parent sweetly smiled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Like infants sporting on the shore,<br />
That tremble not at Ocean&rsquo;s boundless roar),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were they not present to Thy thought,<br />
All souls, that in their cradles Thou hast bought?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But chiefly these, who died for Thee,<br />
That Thou might&rsquo;st live for them a sadder death to see.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next to these, Thy
gracious word<br />
Was as a pledge of benediction stored<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Christian mothers, while they moan<br />
Their treasured hopes, just born, baptised, and gone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, joy for Rachel&rsquo;s broken heart!<br />
She and her babes shall meet no more to part;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So dear to Christ her pious haste<br />
To trust them in His arms for ever safe embraced.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dares not grudge to leave
them there,<br />
Where to behold them was her heart&rsquo;s first prayer;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She dares not grieve&mdash;but she must weep,<br />
As her pale placid martyr sinks to sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Teaching so well and silently<br />
How at the shepherd&rsquo;s call the lamb should die:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How happier far than life the end<br />
Of souls that infant-like beneath their burthen bend.</p>
<h3>First Sunday after Christmas.</h3>
<blockquote><p>So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees
it was gone down.&nbsp; <i>Isaiah</i> xxxviii. 8; compare
<i>Josh.</i> x. 13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;<span
class="smcap">Tis</span> true, of old the unchanging sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His daily course refused to run,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pale moon hurrying to the
west<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Paused at a mortal&rsquo;s call, to aid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The avenging storm of war, that laid<br />
Seven guilty realms at once on earth&rsquo;s defiled breast.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can it be, one suppliant
tear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should stay the ever-moving sphere?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sick man&rsquo;s
lowly-breath&egrave;d sigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When from the world he turns away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hides his weary eyes to pray,<br />
Should change your mystic dance, ye wanderers of the sky?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We too, O Lord, would fain
command,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As then, Thy wonder-working hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And backward force the waves of
Time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That now so swift and silent bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our restless bark from year to year;<br />
Help us to pause and mourn to Thee our tale of crime.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright hopes, that erst the
bosom warmed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And vows, too pure to be performed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And prayers blown wide by gales of
care;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These, and such faint half-waking dreams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like stormy lights on mountain streams,<br />
Wavering and broken all, athwart the conscience glare.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How shall we &rsquo;scape the
o&rsquo;erwhelming Past?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can spirits broken, joys o&rsquo;ercast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And eyes that never more may
smile:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can these th&rsquo; avenging bolt delay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or win us back one little day<br />
The bitterness of death to soften and beguile?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father and Lover of our
souls!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though darkly round Thine anger rolls,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy sunshine smiles beneath the
gloom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou seek&rsquo;st to warn us, not confound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy showers would pierce the hardened ground<br />
And win it to give out its brightness and perfume.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou smil&rsquo;st on us in
wrath, and we,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en in remorse, would smile on Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tears that bathe our offered
hearts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We would not have them stained and dim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But dropped from wings of seraphim,<br />
All glowing with the light accepted love imparts.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time&rsquo;s waters will not
ebb, nor stay;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Power cannot change them, but Love may;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What cannot be, Love counts it
done.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep in the heart, her searching view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can read where Faith is fixed and true,<br />
Through shades of setting life can see Heaven&rsquo;s work
begun.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Thou, who keep&rsquo;st the
Key of Love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Thy fount, eternal Dove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And overflow this heart of
mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enlarging as it fills with Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till in one blaze of charity<br />
Care and remorse are lost, like motes in light divine;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till as each moment wafts us
higher,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By every gush of pure desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And high-breathed hope of joys
above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By every secret sigh we heave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whole years of folly we outlive,<br />
In His unerring sight, who measures Life by Love.</p>
<h3>The Circumcision of Christ.</h3>
<blockquote><p>In whom also ye are circumcised with the
circumcision made without hands.&nbsp; <i>Coloss.</i> ii. 11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">The</span> year begins with Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Thou beginn&rsquo;st with woe,<br />
To let the world of sinners see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That blood for sin must flow.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine infant cries, O
Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy tears upon the breast,<br />
Are not enough&mdash;the legal sword<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must do its stern behest.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sacrificial wine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poured on a victim&rsquo;s head<br />
Are those few precious drops of Thine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now first to offering led.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the pledge and
seal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Christ&rsquo;s unswerving faith<br />
Given to His Sire, our souls to heal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it cost His death.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They to His Church of old,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To each true Jewish heart,<br />
In Gospel graces manifold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Communion blest impart.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now of Thy love we deem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As of an ocean vast,<br />
Mounting in tides against the stream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of ages gone and past.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both theirs and ours Thou
art,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As we and they are Thine;<br />
Kings, Prophets, Patriarchs&mdash;all have part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the sacred line.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By blood and water too<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s mark is set on Thee,<br />
That in Thee every faithful view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both covenants might see.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O bond of union, dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And strong as is Thy grace!<br />
Saints, parted by a thousand year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May thus in heart embrace.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a mourner true,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who fallen on faithless days,<br />
Sighs for the heart-consoling view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of those Heaven deigned to praise?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spirit may&rsquo;st thou
meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With faithful Abraham here,<br />
Whom soon in Eden thou shalt greet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A nursing Father dear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would&rsquo;st thou a poet
be?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And would thy dull heart fain<br />
Borrow of Israel&rsquo;s minstrelsy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One high enraptured strain?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come here thy soul to
tune,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here set thy feeble chant,<br />
Here, if at all beneath the moon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is holy David&rsquo;s haunt.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou a child of tears,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cradled in care and woe?<br />
And seems it hard, thy vernal years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Few vernal joys can show?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fall the sounds of
mirth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sad on thy lonely heart,<br />
From all the hopes and charms of earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Untimely called to part?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look here, and hold thy
peace:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Giver of all good<br />
E&rsquo;en from the womb takes no release<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From suffering, tears, and blood.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou would&rsquo;st reap
in love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; First sow in holy fear:<br />
So life a winter&rsquo;s morn may prove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To a bright endless year.</p>
<h3>Second Sunday after Christmas.</h3>
<blockquote><p>When the poor and needy seek water, and there is
none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear
them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.&nbsp;
<i>Isaiah</i>, xli. 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">And</span> wilt thou hear
the fevered heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Thee in silence cry?<br />
And as th&rsquo; inconstant wildfires dart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the restless eye,<br />
Wilt thou forgive the wayward though<br />
By kindly woes yet half untaught<br />
A Saviours right, so dearly bought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Hope should never die?</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou wilt: for many a languid prayer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has reached Thee from the wild,<br />
Since the lorn mother, wandering there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cast down her fainting child,<br />
Then stole apart to weep and die,<br />
Nor knew an angel form was nigh,<br />
To show soft waters gushing by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dewy shadows mild.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou wilt&mdash;for Thou art Israel&rsquo;s
God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Thine unwearied arm<br />
Is ready yet with Moses&rsquo; rod,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hidden rill to charm<br />
Out of the dry unfathomed deep<br />
Of sands, that lie in lifeless sleep,<br />
Save when the scorching whirlwinds heap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their waves in rude alarm.</p>
<p class="poetry">These moments of wild wrath are Thine&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine, too, the drearier hour<br />
When o&rsquo;er th&rsquo; horizon&rsquo;s silent line<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fond hopeless fancies cower,<br />
And on the traveller&rsquo;s listless way<br />
Rises and sets th&rsquo; unchanging day,<br />
No cloud in heaven to slake its ray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On earth no sheltering bower.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou wilt be there, and not forsake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To turn the bitter pool<br />
Into a bright and breezy lake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This throbbing brow to cool:<br />
Till loft awhile with Thee alone<br />
The wilful heart be fain to own<br />
That He, by whom our bright hours shone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our darkness best may rule.</p>
<p class="poetry">The scent of water far away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the breeze is flung;<br />
The desert pelican to-day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Securely leaves her young,<br />
Reproving thankless man, who fears<br />
To journey on a few lone years,<br />
Where on the sand Thy step appears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy crown in sight is hung.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou, who did sit on Jacob&rsquo;s well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The weary hour of noon,<br />
The languid pulses Thou canst tell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The nerveless spirit tune.<br />
Thou from Whose cross in anguish burst<br />
The cry that owned Thy dying thirst,<br />
To Thee we turn, our Last and First,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Sun and soothing Moon.</p>
<p class="poetry">From darkness, here, and dreariness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask not full repose,<br />
Only be Thou at hand, to bless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our trial hour of woes.<br />
Is not the pilgrim&rsquo;s toil o&rsquo;erpaid<br />
By the clear rill and palmy shade?<br />
And see we not, up Earth&rsquo;s dark glade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gate of Heaven unclose?</p>
<h3>The Epiphany.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went
before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child
was.&nbsp; When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding
great joy.&nbsp; <i>St. Matthew</i> ii. 9, 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Star</span> of the East,
how sweet art Thou,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seen in life&rsquo;s early morning sky,<br />
Ere yet a cloud has dimmed the brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While yet we gaze with childish eye;</p>
<p class="poetry">When father, mother, nursing friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most dearly loved, and loving best,<br />
First bid us from their arms ascend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pointing to Thee, in Thy sure rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">Too soon the glare of earthly day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Buries, to us, Thy brightness keen,<br />
And we are left to find our way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By faith and hope in Thee unseen.</p>
<p class="poetry">What matter? if the waymarks sure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On every side are round us set,<br />
Soon overleaped, but not obscure?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis ours to mark them or forget.</p>
<p class="poetry">What matter? if in calm old age<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our childhood&rsquo;s star again arise,<br />
Crowning our lonely pilgrimage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all that cheers a wanderer&rsquo;s eyes?</p>
<p class="poetry">Ne&rsquo;er may we lose it from our sight,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till all our hopes and thoughts are led<br />
To where it stays its lucid flight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over our Saviour&rsquo;s lowly bed.</p>
<p class="poetry">There, swathed in humblest poverty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Chastity&rsquo;s meek lap enshrined,<br />
With breathless Reverence waiting by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When we our Sovereign Master find,</p>
<p class="poetry">Will not the long-forgotten glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of mingled joy and awe return,<br />
When stars above or flowers below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; First made our infant spirits burn?</p>
<p class="poetry">Look on us, Lord, and take our parts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en on Thy throne of purity!<br />
From these our proud yet grovelling hearts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hide not Thy mild forgiving eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">Did not the Gentile Church find grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our mother dear, this favoured day?<br />
With gold and myrrh she sought Thy face;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor didst Thou turn Thy face away.</p>
<p class="poetry">She too, in earlier, purer days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had watched thee gleaming faint and far&mdash;<br />
But wandering in self-chosen ways<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She lost Thee quite, Thou lovely star.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet had her Father&rsquo;s finger turned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Thee her first inquiring glance:<br />
The deeper shame within her burned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When wakened from her wilful trance.</p>
<p class="poetry">Behold, her wisest throng Thy gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their richest, sweetest, purest store,<br />
(Yet owned too worthless and too late,)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They lavish on Thy cottage-floor.</p>
<p class="poetry">They give their best&mdash;O tenfold shame<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; On us their fallen progeny,<br />
Who sacrifice the blind and lame&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will not wake or fast with Thee!</p>
<h3>First Sunday after Epiphany.</h3>
<blockquote><p>They shall spring up as among the grass, as
willows by the water courses.&nbsp; <i>Isaiah</i> xliv. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Lessons</span> sweet of
spring returning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the thoughtful heart!<br />
May I call ye sense or learning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Instinct pure, or Heaven-taught art?<br />
Be your title what it may,<br />
Sweet this lengthening April day,<br />
While with you the soul is free,<br />
Ranging wild o&rsquo;er hill and lea.</p>
<p class="poetry">Soft as Memnon&rsquo;s harp at morning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the inward ear devout,<br />
Touched by light, with heavenly warning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your transporting chords ring out.<br />
Every leaf in every nook,<br />
Every wave in every brook,<br />
Chanting with a solemn voice,<br />
Minds us of our better choice.</p>
<p class="poetry">Needs no show of mountain hoary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Winding shore or deepening glen,<br />
Where the landscape in its glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Teaches truth to wandering men:<br />
Give true hearts but earth and sky,<br />
And some flowers to bloom and die,<br />
Homely scenes and simple views<br />
Lowly thoughts may best infuse.</p>
<p class="poetry">See the soft green willow springing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the waters gently pass,<br />
Every way her free arms flinging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the moist and reedy grass.<br />
Long ere winter blasts are fled,<br />
See her tipped with vernal red,<br />
And her kindly flower displayed<br />
Ere her leaf can cast a shade.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though the rudest hand assail her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Patiently she droops awhile,<br />
But when showers and breezes hail her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wears again her willing smile.<br />
Thus I learn Contentment&rsquo;s power<br />
From the slighted willow bower,<br />
Ready to give thanks and live<br />
On the least that Heaven may give.</p>
<p class="poetry">If, the quiet brooklet leaving,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up the stony vale I wind,<br />
Haply half in fancy grieving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the shades I leave behind,<br />
By the dusty wayside drear,<br />
Nightingales with joyous cheer<br />
Sing, my sadness to reprove,<br />
Gladlier than in cultured grove.</p>
<p class="poetry">Where the thickest boughs are twining<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the greenest darkest tree,<br />
There they plunge, the light declining&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All may hear, but none may see.<br />
Fearless of the passing hoof,<br />
Hardly will they fleet aloof;<br />
So they live in modest ways,<br />
Trust entire, and ceaseless praise.</p>
<h3>Second Sunday after Epiphany.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Every man at the beginning doth set forth good
wine: and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse; but
thou hast kept the good wine until now.&nbsp; <i>St. John</i> ii.
10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> heart of
childhood is all mirth:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We frolic to and fro<br />
As free and blithe, as if on earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were no such thing as woe.</p>
<p class="poetry">But if indeed with reckless faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We trust the flattering voice,<br />
Which whispers, &ldquo;Take thy fill ere death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Indulge thee and rejoice;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Too surely, every setting day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some lost delight we mourn;<br />
The flowers all die along our way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till we, too, die forlorn.</p>
<p class="poetry">Such is the world&rsquo;s gay garish feast,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In her first charming bowl<br />
Infusing all that fires the breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cheats the unstable soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">And still, as loud the revel swells,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fevered pulse beats higher,<br />
Till the seared taste from foulest wells<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is fain to slake its fire.</p>
<p class="poetry">Unlike the feast of heavenly love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spread at the Saviour&rsquo;s word<br />
For souls that hear His call, and prove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet for His bridal board.</p>
<p class="poetry">Why should we fear, youth&rsquo;s draught of
joy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If pure would sparkle less?<br />
Why should the cup the sooner cloy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which God hath deigned to bless?</p>
<p class="poetry">For, is it Hope, that thrills so keen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along each bounding vein,<br />
Still whispering glorious things unseen?&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith makes the vision plain.</p>
<p class="poetry">The world would kill her soon: but Faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her daring dreams will cherish,<br />
Speeding her gaze o&rsquo;er time and death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To realms where nought can perish.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or is it Love, the dear delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of hearts that know no guile,<br />
That all around see all things bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With their own magic smile?</p>
<p class="poetry">The silent joy that sinks so deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of confidence and rest,<br />
Lulled in a father&rsquo;s arms to sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clasped to a mother&rsquo;s breast?</p>
<p class="poetry">Who, but a Christian, through all life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That blessing may prolong?<br />
Who, through the world&rsquo;s sad day of strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still chant his morning song?</p>
<p class="poetry">Fathers may hate us or forsake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s foundlings then are we:<br />
Mother on child no pity take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But we shall still have Thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">We may look home, and seek in vain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A fond fraternal heart,<br />
But Christ hath given His promise plain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To do a Brother&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor shall dull age, as worldlings say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heavenward flame annoy:<br />
The Saviour cannot pass away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with Him lives our joy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ever the richest, tenderest glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sets round the autumnal sun&mdash;<br />
But there sight fails: no heart may know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bliss when life is done.</p>
<p class="poetry">Such is Thy banquet, dearest Lord;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O give us grace, to cast<br />
Our lot with Thine, to trust Thy word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep our best till last.</p>
<h3>Third Sunday after Epiphany.</h3>
<blockquote><p>When Jesus heard it, He marvelled, and said to
them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so
great faith, no, not in Israel.&nbsp; <i>St. Matthew</i> viii.
10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I <span
class="smcap">marked</span> a rainbow in the north,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time the wild autumnal sun<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From his dark veil at noon looked forth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As glorying in his course half
done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flinging soft radiance far and wide<br />
Over the dusky heaven and bleak hill-side.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a gleam to Memory
dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as I walk and muse apart,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all seems faithless round and drear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would revive it in my heart,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And watch how light can find its way<br />
To regions farthest from the fount of day.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light flashes in the
gloomiest sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Music in the dullest plain,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For there the lark is soaring high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over her flat and leafless
reign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And chanting in so blithe a tone,<br />
It shames the weary heart to feel itself alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighter than rainbow in the
north,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More cheery than the matin
lark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the soft gleam of Christian worth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which on some holy house we
mark;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear to the pastor&rsquo;s aching heart<br />
To think, where&rsquo;er he looks, such gleam may have a
part;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May dwell, unseen by all but
Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like diamond blazing in the
mine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever, where such grace is given,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It fears in open day to shine,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest the deep stain it owns within<br />
Break out, and Faith be shamed by the believer&rsquo;s sin.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence and afar they
wait,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To find a prayer their Lord may
hear:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Voice of the poor and desolate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You best may bring it to His
ear;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your grateful intercessions rise<br />
With more than royal pomp, and pierce the skies.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy the soul whose precious
cause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You in the Sovereign Presence
plead&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the lover of Thy laws,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The friend of Thine in fear and
need,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For to the poor Thy mercy lends<br />
That solemn style, &ldquo;Thy nation and Thy friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He too is blest whose outward
eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The graceful lines of art may
trace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While his free spirit, soaring high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discerns the glorious from the
base;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till out of dust his magic raise<br />
A home for prayer and love, and full harmonious praise,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where far away and high
above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In maze on maze the tranc&egrave;d
sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strays, mindful of that heavenly love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which knows no end in depth or
height,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While the strong breath of Music seems<br />
To waft us ever on, soaring in blissful dreams.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What though in poor and
humble guise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou here didst sojourn,
cottage-born?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet from Thy glory in the skies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our earthly gold Thou dost not
scorn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Love delights to bring her best,<br />
And where Love is, that offering evermore is blest.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love on the Saviour&rsquo;s
dying head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her spikenard drops unblamed may
pour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May mount His cross, and wrap Him dead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spices from the golden
shore;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Risen, may embalm His sacred name<br />
With all a Painter&rsquo;s art, and all a Minstrel&rsquo;s
flame.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worthless and lost our
offerings seem,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drops in the ocean of His
praise;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Mercy with her genial beam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is ripening them to pearly
blaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sparkle in His crown above,<br />
Who welcomes here a child&rsquo;s as there an angel&rsquo;s
love.</p>

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span

&nbsp;&nbsp; To howl and chafe amid the bending trees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch for the still white gleam<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bathe the landscape in a fiery stream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Touching the tremulous eye with sense of light<br />
Too rapid and too pure for all but angel sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know
the Almighty&rsquo;s love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, when the whirlwinds rock the topmost grove,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand in the shade, and hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tumult with a deep exulting fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How, in their fiercest sway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Curbed by some power unseen, they die away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a bold steed that owns his rider&rsquo;s
arm,<br />
Proud to be checked and soothed by that o&rsquo;er-mastering
chains.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there
are storms within<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That heave the struggling heart with wilder din,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; The maniac&rsquo;s rushing frenzy to reprove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when he takes his seat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clothed and in calmness, at his Savour&rsquo;s
feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not the power as strange, the love as blest,<br

As when He said, &ldquo;Be still,&rdquo; and ocean sank to
rest?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to the
wayward heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That gladlier turns to eye the shuddering start<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Passion in her might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than marks the silent growth of grace and
light;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pleased in the cheerless tomb<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To linger, while the morning rays illume<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Green lake, and cedar tuft, and spicy glade,<br />
Shaking their dewy tresses now the storm is laid.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm
is laid&mdash;and now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In His meek power He climbs the mountain&rsquo;s
brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who bade the waves go sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lashed the vexed fiends to their yawning
deep.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How on a rock they stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who watch His eye, and hold His guiding hand!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not half so fixed, amid her vassal hills,<br />
Rises the holy pile that Kedron&rsquo;s valley fills.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wilt
thou seek again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy howling waste, thy charnel-house and chain,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the demons be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than clasp thine own Deliverer&rsquo;s
knee?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure &rsquo;tis no Heaven-bred
awe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That bids thee from His healing touch withdraw;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world and He are struggling in thine heart,<br
/>
And in thy reckless mood thou bidd&rsquo;st thy Lord depart.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He,
merciful and mild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As erst, beholding, loves His wayward child;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When souls of highest birth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Waste their impassioned might on dreams of earth,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He opens Nature&rsquo;s book,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on His glorious Gospel bids them look,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till, by such chords as rule the choirs above,<br />
Their lawless cries are tuned to hymns of perfect love.</p>
<h3>Fifth Sunday after Epiphany.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Behold, the Lord&rsquo;s hand is not shortened,
that it cannot save; neither His ear heavy, that it cannot hear;
but your iniquities have separated between you and your
God.&nbsp; <i>Isaiah</i> lix. 1, 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Wake</span>, arm Divine! awake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eye of the only Wise!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for Thy glory&rsquo;s sake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saviour and God, arise,<br />
And may Thine ear, that seal&egrave;d seems,<br />
In pity mark our mournful themes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus in her lonely hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy Church is fain to cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if Thy love and power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were vanished from her sky;<br />
Yet God is there, and at His side<br />
He triumphs, who for sinners died.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! &rsquo;tis the world
enthralls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Heaven-betroth&egrave;d
breast:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The traitor Sense recalls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soaring soul from rest.<br />
That bitter sigh was all for earth,<br />
For glories gone and vanished mirth.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age would to youth return,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farther from Heaven would be,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To feel the wildfire burn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On idolising knee<br />
Again to fall, and rob Thy shrine<br />
Of hearts, the right of Love Divine.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of this erring flock!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou whose soft showers distil<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; On ocean waste or rock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free as on Hermon hill,<br />
Do Thou our craven spirits cheer,<br />
And shame away the selfish tear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas silent all and
dead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the barren sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Philip&rsquo;s steps were led,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Led by a voice from Thee&mdash;<br
/>
He rose and went, nor asked Thee why,<br />
Nor stayed to heave one faithless sigh:</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his lonely way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The high-born traveller came,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading a mournful lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of &ldquo;One who bore our
shame,<br />
Silent Himself, His name untold,<br />
And yet His glories were of old.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To muse what Heaven might
mean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His wondering brow he raised,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And met an eye serene<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That on him watchful gazed.<br />
No Hermit e&rsquo;er so welcome crossed<br />
A child&rsquo;s lone path in woodland lost.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now wonder turns to love;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scrolls of sacred lore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No darksome mazes prove;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The desert tires no more<br />
They bathe where holy waters flow,<br />
Then on their way rejoicing go.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They part to meet in
Heaven;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But of the joy they share,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolving and forgiven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweet remembrance bear.<br />
Yes&mdash;mark him well, ye cold and proud.<br />
Bewildered in a heartless crowd,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting and turning pale<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Rumour&rsquo;s angry
din&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No storm can now assail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The charm he wears within,<br />
Rejoicing still, and doing good,<br />
And with the thought of God imbued.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No glare of high estate,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No gloom of woe or want,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The radiance can abate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Heaven delights to haunt:<br
/>
Sin only bides the genial ray,<br />
And, round the Cross, makes night of day.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then weep it from thy
heart;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So mayst thou duly learn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The intercessor&rsquo;s part;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy prayers and tears may earn<br
/>
For fallen souls some healing breath,<br />
Era they have died the Apostate&rsquo;s death.</p>
<h3>Sixth Sunday after Epiphany.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth
not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall
appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as he
is.&nbsp; <i>St. John</i> iii. 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">There</span> are, who darkling and alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would wish the weary night were gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though dawning morn should only show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The secret of their unknown woe:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who pray for sharpest throbs of pain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To ease them of doubt&rsquo;s galling chain:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Only disperse the cloud,&rdquo; they cry,<br
/>
&ldquo;And if our fate be death, give light and let us
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwise I deem them, Lord,
unmeet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To profit by Thy chastenings sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Thou wouldst have us linger still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the verge of good or ill.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That on Thy guiding hand unseen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our undivided hearts may lean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And this our frail and foundering bark<br />
Glide in the narrow wake of Thy belov&egrave;d ark.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis so in
war&mdash;the champion true<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Loves victory more when dim in view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sees her glories gild afar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dusky edge of stubborn war,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than if the untrodden bloodless field<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The harvest of her laurels yield;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let not my bark in calm abide,<br />
But win her fearless way against the chafing tide.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis so in
love&mdash;the faithful heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From her dim vision would not part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When first to her fond gaze is given<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That purest spot in Fancy&rsquo;s heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all the gorgeous sky beside,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though pledged her own and sure to abide:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dearer than every past noon-day<br />
That twilight gleam to her, though faint and far away.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So have I seen some tender
flower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Prized above all the vernal bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheltered beneath the coolest shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Embosomed in the greenest glade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So frail a gem, it scarce may bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The playful touch of evening air;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When hardier grown we love it less,<br />
And trust it from our sight, not needing our caress.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wherefore is the sweet
spring-tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Worth all the changeful year beside?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last-born babe, why lies its part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep in the mother&rsquo;s inmost heart?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But that the Lord and Source of love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would have His weakest ever prove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our tenderest care&mdash;and most of all<br />
Our frail immortal souls, His work and Satan&rsquo;s thrall.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So be it, Lord; I know it
best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though not as yet this wayward breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beat quite in answer to Thy voice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet surely I have made my choice;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I know not yet the promised bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Know not if I shall win or miss;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So doubting, rather let me die,<br />
Than close with aught beside, to last eternally.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Heaven we idly
dream?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The self-deceiver&rsquo;s dreary theme,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A cloudless sun that softly shines,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright maidens and unfailing vines,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The warrior&rsquo;s pride, the hunter&rsquo;s
mirth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor fragments all of this low earth:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as in sleep would hardly soothe<br />
A soul that once had tasted of immortal Truth.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Heaven our God
bestows?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No Prophet yet, no Angel knows;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was never yet created eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could see across Eternity;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not seraph&rsquo;s wing for ever soaring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can pass the flight of souls adoring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That nearer still and nearer grow<br />
To the unapproach&egrave;d Lord, once made for them so low.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseen, unfelt their earthly
growth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And self-accused of sin and sloth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They live and die; their names decay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their fragrance passes quite away;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like violets in the freezing blast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No vernal steam around they cast.&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they shall flourish from the tomb,<br />
The breath of God shall wake them into odorous bloom.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the incarnate
Saviour&rsquo;s breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fount of sweetness, they shall rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their spirits every hour imbued<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More deeply with His precious blood.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But peace&mdash;still voice and clos&egrave;d eye<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Suit best with hearts beyond the sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearts training in their low abode,<br />
Daily to lose themselves in hope to find their God.</p>
<h3>Septuagesima Sunday.</h3>
<blockquote><p>The invisible things of Him from the creation of
the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that
are made.&nbsp; <i>Romans</i> i. 20.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a book, who
runs may read,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which heavenly truth imparts,<br />
And all the lore its scholars need,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pure eyes and Christian hearts.</p>
<p class="poetry">The works of God above, below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within us and around,<br />
Are pages in that book, to show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How God Himself is found.</p>
<p class="poetry">The glorious sky embracing all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is like the Maker&rsquo;s love,<br />
Wherewith encompassed, great and small<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In peace and order move.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Moon above, the Church below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A wondrous race they run,<br />
But all their radiance, all their glow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each borrows of its Sun.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Savour lends the light and heat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That crowns His holy hill;<br />
The saints, like stars, around His seat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perform their courses still.</p>
<p class="poetry">The saints above are stars in heaven&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the saints on earth?<br />
Like tress they stand whom God has given,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Eden&rsquo;s happy birth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Faith is their fixed unswerving root,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope their unfading flower,<br />
Fair deeds of charity their fruit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The glory of their bower.</p>
<p class="poetry">The dew of heaven is like Thy grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It steals in silence down;<br />
But where it lights, this favoured place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By richest fruits is known.</p>
<p class="poetry">One Name above all glorious names<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With its ten thousand tongues<br />
The everlasting sea proclaims.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Echoing angelic songs.</p>
<p class="poetry">The raging Fire, the roaring Wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy boundless power display;<br />
But in the gentler breeze we find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy Spirit&rsquo;s viewless way.</p>
<p class="poetry">Two worlds are ours: &rsquo;tis only Sin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forbids us to descry<br />
The mystic heaven and earth within,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Plain as the sea and sky.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou, who hast given me eyes to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And love this sight so fair,<br />
Give me a heart to find out Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And read Thee everywhere.</p>
<h3>Sexagesima Sunday.</h3>
<blockquote><p>So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east
of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.&nbsp;
<i>Genesis</i> iii. 24; compare chap. vi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Foe</span> of mankind! too bold thy race:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou runn&rsquo;st at such a reckless pace,<br />
Thine own dire work thou surely wilt confound:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas but one little drop of sin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw this morning enter in,<br />
And lo! at eventide the world is drowned.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See here the fruit of
wandering eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of worldly longings to be wise,<br />
Of Passion dwelling on forbidden sweets:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye lawless glances, freely rove;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruin below and wrath above<br />
Are all that now the wildering fancy meets.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, when in some deep
garden glade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Thee and of myself afraid.<br />
From thoughts like these among the bowers I hide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearest and loudest then of all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I seem to hear the Judge&rsquo;s call:&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Where art thou, fallen man? come forth, and be thou
tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling before Thee as I
stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where&rsquo;er I gaze on either hand<br />
The sentence is gone forth, the ground is cursed:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet mingled with the penal shower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some drops of balm in every bower<br />
Steal down like April dews, that softest fall and first.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If filial and maternal
love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Memorial of our guilt must prove,<br />
If sinful babes in sorrow must be born,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, to assuage her sharpest throes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The faithful mother surely knows,<br />
This was the way Thou cam&rsquo;st to save the world forlorn.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If bless&egrave;d wedlock may
not bless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without some tinge of bitterness<br />
To dash her cup of joy, since Eden lost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chaining to earth with strong desire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearts that would highest else aspire,<br />
And o&rsquo;er the tenderer sex usurping ever most;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet by the light of Christian
lore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis blind Idolatry no more,<br />
But a sweet help and pattern of true love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Showing how best the soul may cling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To her immortal Spouse and King,<br />
How He should rule, and she with full desire approve.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If niggard Earth her
treasures hide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To all but labouring hands denied,<br />
Lavish of thorns and worthless weeds alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The doom is half in mercy given,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To train us in our way to Heaven,<br />
And show our lagging souls how glory must be won.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If on the sinner&rsquo;s
outward frame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God hath impressed His mark of blame,<br />
And e&rsquo;en our bodies shrink at touch of light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet mercy hath not left us bare:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The very weeds we daily wear<br />
Are to Faith&rsquo;s eye a pledge of God&rsquo;s forgiving
might.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh! if yet one arrow
more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sharpest of the Almighty&rsquo;s store,<br />
Tremble upon the string&mdash;a sinner&rsquo;s death&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Art Thou not by to soothe and save,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To lay us gently in the grave,<br />
To close the weary eye and hush the parting breath?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore in sight of man
bereft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The happy garden still was left;<br />
The fiery sword that guarded, showed it too;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning all ways, the world to teach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That though as yet beyond our reach,<br />
Still in its place the tree of life and glory grew.</p>
<h3>Quinquagesima Sunday.</h3>
<blockquote><p>I do set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for
a token of a covenant between Me and the earth.&nbsp;

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Sweet</span> Dove! the

&nbsp;&nbsp; We hail ye, one and all,<br />
As when our fathers walked abroad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Freed from their twelvemonth&rsquo;s thrall.</p>
<p class="poetry">How joyful from the imprisoning ark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the green earth they spring!<br />
Not blither, after showers, the lark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mounts up with glistening wing.</p>
<p class="poetry">So home-bound sailors spring to shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two oceans safely past;<br />
So happy souls, when life is o&rsquo;er,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Plunge in this empyreal vast.</p>
<p class="poetry">What wins their first and fondest gaze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the blissful field,<br />
And keeps it through a thousand days?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love face to face revealed:</p>
<p class="poetry">Love imaged in that cordial look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Lord in Eden bends<br />
On souls that sin and earth forsook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In time to die His friends.</p>
<p class="poetry">And what most welcome and serene<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dawns on the Patriarch&rsquo;s eye,<br />
In all the emerging hills so green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the brightening sky?</p>
<p class="poetry">What but the gentle rainbow&rsquo;s gleam,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Soothing the wearied sight,<br />
That cannot bear the solar beam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With soft undazzling light?</p>
<p class="poetry">Lord, if our fathers turned to Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such adoring gaze,<br />
Wondering frail man Thy light should see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without Thy scorching blaze;</p>
<p class="poetry">Where is our love, and where our hearts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We who have seen Thy Son,<br />
Have tried Thy Spirit&rsquo;s winning arts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet we are not won?</p>
<p class="poetry">The Son of God in radiance beamed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too bright for us to scan,<br />
But we may face the rays that streamed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the mild Son of Man.</p>
<p class="poetry">There, parted into rainbow hues,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In sweet harmonious strife<br />
We see celestial love diffuse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its light o&rsquo;er Jesus&rsquo; life.</p>
<p class="poetry">God, by His bow, vouchsafes to write<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This truth in Heaven above:<br />
As every lovely hue is Light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So every grace is Love.</p>
<h3>Ash Wednesday.</h3>
<blockquote><p>When thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
face; that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
which is in secret.&nbsp; <i>St. Matthew</i> vi. 17, 18.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Yes</span>&mdash;deep within and deeper yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rankling shaft of conscience hide,<br />
Quick let the swelling eye forget<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tears that in the heart abide.<br />
Calm be the voice, the aspect bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No shuddering pass o&rsquo;er lip or brow,<br />
For why should Innocence be told<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The pangs that guilty spirits bow?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The loving eye that watches thine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Close as the air that wraps thee round&mdash;<br />
Why in thy sorrow should it pine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since never of thy sin it found?<br />
And wherefore should the heathen see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What chains of darkness thee enslave,<br />
And mocking say, &lsquo;Lo, this is he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who owned a God that could not
save&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus oft the mourner&rsquo;s wayward heart<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tempts him to hide his grief and die,<br />
Too feeble for Confession&rsquo;s smart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too proud to bear a pitying eye;<br />
How sweet, in that dark hour, to fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On bosoms waiting to receive<br />
Our sighs, and gently whisper all!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They love us&mdash;will not God forgive?</p>
<p class="poetry">Else let us keep our fast within,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till Heaven and we are quite alone,<br />
Then let the grief, the shame, the sin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the mercy-seat be thrown.<br />
Between the porch and altar weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unworthy of the holiest place,<br />
Yet hoping near the shrine to keep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One lowly cell in sight of grace.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor fear lest sympathy should fail&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou not seen, in night hours drear,<br />
When racking thoughts the heart assail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The glimmering stars by turns appear,<br />
And from the eternal house above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With silent news of mercy steal?<br />
So Angels pause on tasks of love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To look where sorrowing sinners kneel.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or if no Angel pass that way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He who in secret sees, perchance<br />
May bid His own heart-warming ray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toward thee stream with kindlier glance,<br />
As when upon His drooping head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His Father&rsquo;s light was poured from Heaven,<br
/>
What time, unsheltered and unfed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far in the wild His steps were driven.</p>
<p class="poetry">High thoughts were with Him in that hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Untold, unspeakable on earth&mdash;<br />
And who can stay the soaring power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of spirits weaned from worldly mirth,<br />
While far beyond the sound of praise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With upward eye they float serene,<br />
And learn to bear their Saviour&rsquo;s blaze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Judgment shall undraw the screen?</p>
<h3>First Sunday in Lent.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Haste thee, escape thither: for I cannot do any

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Angel</span> of
wrath! why linger in mid-air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While the devoted city&rsquo;s cry<br />
Louder and louder swells? and canst thou spare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy full-charged vial standing by?&rdquo;<br />
Thus, with stern voice, unsparing Justice pleads:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He hears her not&mdash;with softened gaze<br />
His eye is following where sweet Mercy leads,<br />
And till she give the sign, his fury stays.</p>
<p class="poetry">Guided by her, along the mountain road,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far through the twilight of the morn,<br />
With hurried footsteps from the accursed abode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sees the holy household borne;<br />
Angels, or more, on either hand are nigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To speed them o&rsquo;er the tempting plain,<br />
Lingering in heart, and with frail sidelong eye<br />
Seeking how near they may unharmed remain.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Ah! wherefore gleam those upland slopes
so fair?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And why, through every woodland arch,<br />
Swells yon bright vale, as Eden rich and rare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Jordan winds his stately march;<br />
If all must be forsaken, ruined all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If God have planted but to burn?&mdash;<br />
Surely not yet the avenging shower will fall,<br />
Though to my home for one last look I turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus while they waver, surely long ago<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They had provoked the withering blast,<br />
But that the merciful Avengers know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their frailty well, and hold them fast.<br />
&ldquo;Haste, for thy life escape, nor look
behind&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever in thrilling sounds like these<br />
They check the wandering eye, severely kind,<br />
Nor let the sinner lose his soul at ease.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when, o&rsquo;erwearied with the steep
ascent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We for a nearer refuge crave,<br />
One little spot of ground in mercy lent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One hour of home before the grave,<br />
Oft in His pity o&rsquo;er His children weak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His hand withdraws the penal fire,<br />
And where we fondly cling, forbears to wreak<br />
Full vengeance, till our hearts are weaned entire.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus, by the merits of one righteous man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Church, our Zoar, shall abide,<br />
Till she abuse, so sore, her lengthened span,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en Mercy&rsquo;s self her face must hide.<br
/>
Then, onward yet a step, thou hard-won soul;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though in the Church thou know thy place,<br />
The mountain farther lies&mdash;there seek thy goal,<br />
There breathe at large, o&rsquo;erpast thy dangerous race.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet is the smile of home; the mutual look<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When hearts are of each other sure;<br />
Sweet all the joys that crowd the household nook,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The haunt of all affections pure;<br />
Yet in the world e&rsquo;en these abide, and we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the world our calling boast;<br />
Once gain the mountain-top, and thou art free:<br />
Till then, who rest, presume; who turn to look, are lost.</p>
<h3>Second Sunday in Lent.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And when Esau heard the words of his father, he
cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his
father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.&nbsp; <i>Genesis</i>
xxvii. 34.&nbsp; (Compare <i>Hebrews</i> xii. 17.&nbsp;&nbsp; He
found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with
tears.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">And</span> is there
in God&rsquo;s world so drear a place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the loud bitter cry is raised in vain?<br />
Where tears of penance come too late for grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As on the uprooted flower the genial
rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis even so: the sovereign Lord of
souls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stores in the dungeon of His boundless realm<br />
Each bolt that o&rsquo;er the sinner vainly rolls,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With gathered wrath the reprobate to whelm.</p>
<p class="poetry">Will the storm hear the sailor&rsquo;s piteous
cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Taught so mistrust, too late, the tempting wave,<br
/>
When all around he sees but sea and sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A God in anger, a self-chosen grave?</p>
<p class="poetry">Or will the thorns, that strew
intemperance&rsquo; bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn with a wish to down? will late remorse<br />
Recall the shaft the murderer&rsquo;s hand has sped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or from the guiltless bosom turn its course?</p>
<p class="poetry">Then may the unbodied soul in safety fleet<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the dark curtains of the world above,<br />
Fresh from the stain of crime; nor fear to meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The God whom here she would not learn to love;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then is there hope for such as die unblest,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That angel wings may waft them to the shore,<br />
Nor need the unready virgin strike her breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor wait desponding round the bridegroom&rsquo;s
door.</p>
<p class="poetry">But where is then the stay of contrite
hearts?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of old they leaned on Thy eternal word,<br />
But with the sinner&rsquo;s fear their hope departs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast linked as Thy great Name to Thee, O Lord:</p>
<p class="poetry">That Name, by which Thy faithful oath is
past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That we should endless be, for joy or woe:&mdash;<br
/>
And if the treasures of Thy wrath could waste,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy lovers must their promised Heaven forego.</p>
<p class="poetry">But ask of elder days, earth&rsquo;s vernal
hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When in familiar talk God&rsquo;s voice was
heard,<br />
When at the Patriarch&rsquo;s call the fiery shower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Propitious o&rsquo;er the turf-built shrine
appeared.</p>
<p class="poetry">Watch by our father Isaac&rsquo;s pastoral
door&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The birthright sold, the blessing lost and won;<br
/>
Tell, Heaven has wrath that can relent no more;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grave, dark deeds that cannot be undone.</p>
<p class="poetry">We barter life for pottage; sell true bliss<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For wealth or power, for pleasure or renown;<br />
Thus, Esau-like, our Father&rsquo;s blessing miss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then wash with fruitless tears our faded crown.</p>
<p class="poetry">Our faded crown, despised and flung aside,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall on some brother&rsquo;s brow immortal
bloom;<br />
No partial hand the blessing may misguide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No flattering fancy change our Monarch&rsquo;s
doom:</p>
<p class="poetry">His righteous doom, that meek true-hearted
Love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The everlasting birthright should receive,<br />
The softest dews drop on her from above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The richest green her mountain garland weave:</p>
<p class="poetry">Her brethren, mightiest, wisest,
eldest-born,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bow to her sway, and move at her behest;<br />
Isaac&rsquo;s fond blessing may not fall on scorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor Balaam&rsquo;s curse on Love, which God hath
blest.</p>
<h3>Third Sunday in Lent.</h3>
<blockquote><p>When a strong man armed keepeth his place, his
goods are in peace; but when a stronger than he shall come upon
him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein
he trusted, and divideth his spoils.&nbsp; <i>St. Luke</i> xi.
21, 22.</p>

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dashed from his
throne of pride;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While, answering Thy victorious
call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Saints his
spoils divide;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This world of Thine, by him usurped too long,<br />
Now opening all her stores to heal Thy servants&rsquo; wrong.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the
first-born of Thy foes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead in the
darkness lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Thy redeemed at midnight
rose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cast their
bonds away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The orphaned realm threw wide her gates, and told<br
/>
Into freed Israel&rsquo;s lap her jewels and her gold.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when
their wondrous march was o&rsquo;er,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they had won
their homes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Abraham fed his flock of
yore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among their
fathers&rsquo; tombs;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A land that drinks the rain of Heaven at will,<br />
Whose waters kiss the feet of many a vine-clad hill;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft as they
watched, at thoughtful eve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gale from
bowers of balm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweep o&rsquo;er the billowy corn,
and heave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tresses of
the palm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the lingering Sun had touched with gold,<br
/>
Far o&rsquo;er the cedar shade, some tower of giants old;</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
was a fearful joy, I ween,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To trace the Heathen&rsquo;s
toil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The limpid
wells, the orchards green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left ready for the spoil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The household stores untouched, the roses bright<br
/>
Wreathed o&rsquo;er the cottage walls in garlands of delight.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now
another Canaan yields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Thine
all-conquering ark:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fly from the &ldquo;old
poetic&rdquo; fields,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye Paynim
shadows dark!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Immortal Greece, dear land of glorious lays,<br />
Lo! here the &ldquo;unknown God&rdquo; of thy unconscious
praise.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
olive-wreath, the ivied wand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The sword
in myrtles drest,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each legend of the shadowy
strand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now wakes a
vision blest;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As little children lisp, and tell of Heaven,<br />
So thoughts beyond their thought to those high Bards were
given.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these
are ours: Thy partial grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tempting
treasure lends:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These relies of a guilty race<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are forfeit to
Thy friends;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What seemed an idol hymn, now breathes of Thee,<br
/>
Tuned by Faith&rsquo;s ear to some celestial melody.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s
not a strain to Memory dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor flower in
classic grove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a sweet note
warbled here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But minds us of
Thy Love.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O Lord, our Lord, and spoiler of our foes,<br />
There is no light but Thine: with Thee all beauty glows.</p>
<h3>Fourth Sunday in Lent.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon
his brother; and he sought where to weep, and he entered into his
chamber and wept there.&nbsp; <i>Genesis</i> xliii. 30.</p>
<p>There stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known
unto his brethren.&nbsp; <i>Genesis</i> xlv. 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> Nature tries
her finest touch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weaving her vernal wreath,<br />
Mark ye, how close she veils her round,<br />
Not to be traced by sight or sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor soiled by ruder breath?</p>
<p class="poetry">Who ever saw the earliest rose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; First open her sweet breast?<br />
Or, when the summer sun goes down,<br />
The first soft star in evening&rsquo;s crown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Light up her gleaming crest?</p>
<p class="poetry">Fondly we seek the dawning bloom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On features wan and fair,<br />
The gazing eye no change can trace,<br />
But look away a little space,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then turn, and lo! &rsquo;tis there.</p>
<p class="poetry">But there&rsquo;s a sweeter flower than
e&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blushed on the rosy spray&mdash;<br />
A brighter star, a richer bloom<br />
Than e&rsquo;er did western heaven illume<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At close of summer day.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis Love, the last best gift of
Heaven;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love gentle, holy, pure;<br />
But tenderer than a dove&rsquo;s soft eye,<br />
The searching sun, the open sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She never could endure.</p>
<p class="poetry">E&rsquo;en human Love will shrink from sight<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here in the coarse rude earth:<br />
How then should rash intruding glance<br />
Break in upon <i>her</i> sacred trance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who boasts a heavenly birth?</p>
<p class="poetry">So still and secret is her growth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever the truest heart,<br />
Where deepest strikes her kindly root<br />
For hope or joy, for flower or fruit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Least knows its happy part.</p>
<p class="poetry">God only, and good angels, look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the blissful screen&mdash;<br />
As when, triumphant o&rsquo;er His woes,<br />
The Son of God by moonlight rose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By all but Heaven unseen:</p>
<p class="poetry">As when the holy Maid beheld<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her risen Son and Lord:<br />
Thought has not colours half so fair<br />
That she to paint that hour may dare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In silence best adored.</p>
<p class="poetry">The gracious Dove, that brought from Heaven<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The earnest of our bliss,<br />
Of many a chosen witness telling,<br />
On many a happy vision dwelling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sings not a note of this.</p>
<p class="poetry">So, truest image of the Christ,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Israel&rsquo;s long-lost son,<br />
What time, with sweet forgiving cheer,<br />
He called his conscious brethren near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would weep with them alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">He could not trust his melting soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But in his Maker&rsquo;s sight&mdash;<br />
Then why should gentle hearts and true<br />
Bare to the rude world&rsquo;s withering view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their treasure of delight!</p>
<p class="poetry">No&mdash;let the dainty rose awhile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her bashful fragrance hide&mdash;<br />
Rend not her silken veil too soon,<br />
But leave her, in her own soft noon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To flourish and abide.</p>
<h3>Fifth Sunday in Lent.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see
this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.&nbsp; <i>Exodus</i>
iii. 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> historic Muse,
from age to age,<br />
Through many a waste heart-sickening page<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath traced the works of Man:<br />
But a celestial call to-day<br />
Stays her, like Moses, on her way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The works of God to scan.</p>
<p class="poetry">Far seen across the sandy wild,<br />
Where, like a solitary child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He thoughtless roamed and free,<br />
One towering thorn was wrapt in flame&mdash;<br />
Bright without blaze it went and came:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who would not turn and see?</p>
<p class="poetry">Along the mountain ledges green<br />
The scattered sheep at will may glean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Desert&rsquo;s spicy stores:<br />
The while, with undivided heart,<br />
The shepherd talks with God apart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, as he talks, adores.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye too, who tend Christ&rsquo;s wildering
flock,<br />
Well may ye gather round the rock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That once was Sion&rsquo;s hill:<br />
To watch the fire upon the mount<br />
Still blazing, like the solar fount,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet unconsuming still.</p>
<p class="poetry">Caught from that blaze by wrath Divine,<br />
Lost branches of the once-loved vine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now withered, spent, and sere,<br />
See Israel&rsquo;s sons, like glowing brands,<br />
Tossed wildly o&rsquo;er a thousand lands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For twice a thousand year.</p>
<p class="poetry">God will not quench nor slay them quite,<br />
But lifts them like a beacon-light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The apostate Church to scare;<br />
Or like pale ghosts that darkling roam,<br />
Hovering around their ancient home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But find no refuge there.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye bless&egrave;d Angels! if of you<br />
There be, who love the ways to view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Kings and Kingdoms here;<br />
(And sure, &rsquo;tis worth an Angel&rsquo;s gaze,<br />
To see, throughout that dreary maze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God teaching love and fear:)</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh say, in all the bleak expanse<br />
Is there a spot to win your glance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So bright, so dark as this?<br />
A hopeless faith, a homeless race,<br />
Yet seeking the most holy place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And owning the true bliss!</p>
<p class="poetry">Salted with fire they seem, to show<br />
How spirits lost in endless woe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May undecaying live.<br />
Oh, sickening thought! yet hold it fast<br />
Long as this glittering world shall last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or sin at heart survive.</p>
<p class="poetry">And hark! amid the flashing fire,<br />
Mingling with tones of fear and ire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soft Mercy&rsquo;s undersong&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis Abraham&rsquo;s God who speaks so loud,<br />
His people&rsquo;s cries have pierced the cloud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sees, He sees their wrong;</p>
<p class="poetry">He is come down to break their chain;<br />
Though nevermore on Sion&rsquo;s fane<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His visible ensign wave;<br />
&rsquo;Tis Sion, wheresoe&rsquo;er they dwell,<br />
Who, with His own true Israel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall own Him strong to save.</p>
<p class="poetry">He shall redeem them one by one,<br />
Where&rsquo;er the world-encircling sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall see them meekly kneel:<br />
All that He asks on Israel&rsquo;s part,<br />
Is only that the captive heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its woe and burthen feel.</p>
<p class="poetry">Gentiles! with fixed yet awful eye<br />
Turn ye this page of mystery,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor slight the warning sound:<br />
&ldquo;Put off thy shoes from off thy feet&mdash;<br />
The place where man his God shall meet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure, is holy ground.&rdquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Who in that divinest spell<br />
Dare not hope to join on earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give us grace to listen well.</p>
<p class="poetry">But should thankless silence seal<br />
Lips that might half Heaven reveal,<br />
Should bards in idol-hymns profane<br />
The sacred soul-enthralling strain,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Noblest things find vilest using,)<br />
Then, Thy power and mercy show,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In vile things noble breath infusing;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then waken into sound divine<br />
The very pavement of Thy shrine,<br />
Till we, like Heaven&rsquo;s star-sprinkled floor,<br />
Faintly give back what we adore:<br />
Childlike though the voices be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And untunable the parts,<br />
Thou wilt own the minstrelsy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If it flow from childlike hearts.</p>

So evermore, by Faith&rsquo;s undying glow,<br />
We own the Crucified in weal or woe.</p>
<p class="poetry">Strange to our ears the church-bells of our

Thou never canst forget, nor leave alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">There are who sigh that no fond heart is
theirs,<br />

sigh!<br />
Out of the bosom of His love He spares&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Father spares the Son, for thee to die:<br />
For thee He died&mdash;for thee He lives again:<br />
O&rsquo;er thee He watches in His boundless reign.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou art as much His care, as if beside<br />

Thus sunbeams pour alike their glorious tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To light up worlds, or wake an insect&rsquo;s
mirth:<br />
They shine and shine with unexhausted store&mdash;<br />
Thou art thy Saviour&rsquo;s darling&mdash;seek no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">On thee and thine, thy warfare and thine
end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en in His hour of agony He thought,<br />
When, ere the final pang His soul should rend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ransomed spirits one by one were brought<br />
To His mind&rsquo;s eye&mdash;two silent nights and days<br />
In calmness for His far-seen hour He stays.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye vaulted cells, where martyred seers of
old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far in the rocky walls of Sion sleep,<br />
Green terraces and arch&egrave;d fountains cold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where lies the cypress shade so still and deep,<br

Dear sacred haunts of glory and of woe,<br />
Help us, one hour, to trace His musings high and low:</p>
<p class="poetry">One heart-ennobling hour!&nbsp; It may not
be:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The unearthly thoughts have passed from earth
away,<br />
And fast as evening sunbeams from the sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy footsteps all in Sion&rsquo;s deep decay<br />
Were blotted from the holy ground: yet dear<br />
Is every stone of hers; for Thou want surely here.</p>
<p class="poetry">There is a spot within this sacred dale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That felt Thee kneeling&mdash;touched Thy prostrate
brow:<br />
One Angel knows it.&nbsp; O might prayer avail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To win that knowledge! sure each holy vow<br />
Less quickly from the unstable soul would fade,<br />
Offered where Christ in agony was laid.</p>
<p class="poetry">Might tear of ours once mingle with the
blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That from His aching brow by moonlight fell,<br />
Over the mournful joy our thoughts would brood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till they had framed within a guardian spell<br />
To chase repining fancies, as they rise,<br />
Like birds of evil wing, to mar our sacrifice.</p>
<p class="poetry">So dreams the heart self-flattering, fondly
dreams;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Else wherefore, when the bitter waves
o&rsquo;erflow,<br />
Miss we the light, Gethsemane, that streams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From thy dear name, where in His page of woe<br />
It shines, a pale kind star in winter&rsquo;s sky?<br />
Who vainly reads it there, in vain had seen Him die.</p>

And the sad burthen pressed Him so to earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The very torturers paused<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To help Him on His way.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Fill high the bowl, benumb His aching
sense<br />
With medicined sleep.&rdquo;&mdash;O awful in Thy woe!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The parching thirst of death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is on Thee, and Thou triest</p>
<p class="poetry">The slumb&rsquo;rous potion bland, and wilt not
drink:<br />
Not sullen, nor in scorn, like haughty man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With suicidal hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting his solace by:</p>
<p class="poetry">But as at first Thine all-pervading look<br />
Saw from Thy Father&rsquo;s bosom to the abyss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Measuring in calm presage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The infinite descent;</p>
<p class="poetry">So to the end, though now of mortal pangs<br />
Made heir, and emptied of Thy glory, awhile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With unaverted eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou meetest all the storm.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou wilt feel all, that Thou mayst pity
all;<br />
And rather wouldst Thou wreathe with strong pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than overcloud Thy soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So clear in agony,</p>
<p class="poetry">Or lose one glimpse of Heaven before the
time<br />
O most entire and perfect sacrifice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Renewed in every pulse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That on the tedious Cross</p>
<p class="poetry">Told the long hours of death, as, one by
one,<br />
The life-strings of that tender heart gave way;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en sinners, taught by Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look Sorrow in the face,</p>
<p class="poetry">And bid her freely welcome, unbeguiled<br />
By false kind solaces, and spells of earth:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet not all unsoothed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For when was Joy so dear,</p>
<p class="poetry">As the deep calm that breathed,
&ldquo;<i>Father</i>, <i>forgive</i>,&rdquo;<br />
Or, &ldquo;<i>Be with Me in Paradise to-day</i>?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, though the strife be sore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet in His parting breath</p>
<p class="poetry">Love masters Agony; the soul that seemed<br />
Forsaken, feels her present God again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in her Father&rsquo;s arms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Contented dies away.</p>
<h3>Wednesday before Easter.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Saying, Father, if Thou be willing, remove this
cup from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Thine, be done.&nbsp;
<i>St. Luke</i> xxii. 42.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God, do
thou Thy holy will&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will lie still&mdash;<br />
I will not stir, lest I forsake Thine arm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And break the charm<br />
Which lulls me, clinging to my Father&rsquo;s breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In perfect rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">Wild fancy, peace! thou must not me beguile<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With thy false smile:<br />
I know thy flatteries and thy cheating ways;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be silent, Praise,<br />
Blind guide with siren voice, and blinding all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That hear thy call.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come, Self-devotion, high and pure,<br />
Thoughts that in thankfulness endure,<br />
Though dearest hopes are faithless found,<br />
And dearest hearts are bursting round.<br />
Come, Resignation, spirit meek,<br />
And let me kiss thy placid cheek,<br />
And read in thy pale eye serene<br />
Their blessing, who by faith can wean<br />
Their hearts from sense, and learn to love<br />
God only, and the joys above.</p>
<p class="poetry">They say, who know the life divine,<br />
And upward gaze with eagle eyne,<br />
That by each golden crown on high,<br />
Rich with celestial jewelry,<br />
Which for our Lord&rsquo;s redeemed is set,<br />
There hangs a radiant coronet,<br />
All gemmed with pure and living light,<br />
Too dazzling for a sinner&rsquo;s sight,<br />
Prepared for virgin souls, and them<br />
Who seek the martyr&rsquo;s diadem.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor deem, who to that bliss aspire,<br />
Must win their way through blood and fire.<br />
The writhings of a wounded heart<br />
Are fiercer than a foeman&rsquo;s dart.<br />
Oft in Life&rsquo;s stillest shade reclining,<br />
In Desolation unrepining,<br />
Without a hope on earth to find<br />
A mirror in an answering mind,<br />
Meek souls there are, who little dream<br />
Their daily strife an Angel&rsquo;s theme,<br />
Or that the rod they take so calm<br />
Shall prove in Heaven a martyr&rsquo;s palm.</p>
<p class="poetry">And there are souls that seem to dwell<br />
Above this earth&mdash;so rich a spell<br />
Floats round their steps, where&rsquo;er they move,<br />
From hopes fulfilled and mutual love.<br />
Such, if on high their thoughts are set,<br />
Nor in the stream the source forget,<br />
If prompt to quit the bliss they know,<br />
Following the Lamb where&rsquo;er He go,<br />
By purest pleasures unbeguiled<br />
To idolise or wife or child;<br />
Such wedded souls our God shall own<br />
For faultless virgins round His throne.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus everywhere we find our suffering God,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where He trod<br />
May set our steps: the Cross on Calvary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Uplifted high<br />
Beams on the martyr host, a beacon light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In open fight.</p>
<p class="poetry">To the still wrestlings of the lonely heart<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He doth impart<br />
The virtue of his midnight agony,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When none was nigh,<br />
Save God and one good angel, to assuage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tempest&rsquo;s rage.</p>
<p class="poetry">Mortal! if life smile on thee, and thou find<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; All to thy mind,<br />
Think, who did once from Heaven to Hell descend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee to befriend:<br />
So shalt thou dare forego, at His dear call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy best, thine all.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;O Father! not My will, but Thine be
done&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So spake the Son.<br />
Be this our charm, mellowing Earth&rsquo;s ruder noise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of griefs and joys:<br />
That we may cling for ever to Thy breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In perfect rest!</p>
<h3>Thursday before Easter.</h3>
<blockquote><p>As the beginning of thy supplications the
commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art
greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider
the vision.&nbsp; <i>Daniel</i> ix. 23.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;O <span
class="smcap">Holy</span> mountain of my God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do thy towers in ruin lie,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How art thou riven and strewn abroad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the rude and wasteful
sky!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas thus upon his fasting-day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The &ldquo;Man of Loves&rdquo; was fain to pray,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His lattice open toward his darling west,<br />
Mourning the ruined home he still must love the best.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! for a love like
Daniel&rsquo;s now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To wing to Heaven but one strong
prayer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> new
Israel, sunk as low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet flourishing to sight as
fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As Sion in her height of pride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With queens for handmaids at her side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With kings her nursing-fathers, thron&egrave;d
high,<br />
And compassed with the world&rsquo;s too tempting blazonry.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis true, nor winter
stays thy growth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor torrid summer&rsquo;s sickly
smile;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The flashing billows of the south<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Break not upon so lone an isle,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou, rich vine, art grafted there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fruit of death or life to bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yielding a surer witness every day,<br />
To thine Almighty Author and His steadfast sway.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! grief to think, that
grapes of gall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should cluster round thine
healthiest shoot!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s herald prove a heartless thrall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, if he dared, would fain be
mute!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en such is this bad world we see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which self-condemned in owning Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet dares not open farewell of Thee take,<br />
For very pride, and her high-boasted Reason&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we then? if far and
wide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men kneel to <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, the pure and meek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet rage with passion, swell with pride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have we not still our faith to
seek?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay&mdash;but in steadfast humbleness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kneel on to Him, who loves to bless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The prayer that waits for him; and trembling
strive<br />
To keep the lingering flame in thine own breast alive.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark frowned the future
e&rsquo;en on him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The loving and belov&egrave;d
Seer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What time he saw, through shadows dim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boundary of th&rsquo; eternal
year;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He only of the sons of men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Named to be heir of glory then.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Else had it bruised too sore his tender heart<br />
To see <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> ransomed world in
wrath and flame depart</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then look no more: or closer
watch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy course in Earth&rsquo;s
bewildering ways,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For every glimpse thine eye can catch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of what shall be in those dread
days:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So when th&rsquo; Archangel&rsquo;s word is
spoken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Death&rsquo;s deep trance for ever broken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In mercy thou mayst feel the heavenly hand,<br />
And in thy lot unharmed before thy Savour stand.</p>
<h3>Good Friday.</h3>
<blockquote><p>He is despised and rejected of men.&nbsp;
<i>Isaiah</i> liii. 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Is</span>
it not strange, the darkest hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That ever dawned on sinful
earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should touch the heart with softer power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For comfort than an angel&rsquo;s
mirth?<br />
That to the Cross the mourner&rsquo;s eye should turn<br />
Sooner than where the stars of Christmas burn?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner than where the Easter
sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shines glorious on yon open
grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to and fro the tidings run,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who died to heal, is risen
to save?&rdquo;<br />
Sooner than where upon the Saviour&rsquo;s friends<br />
The very Comforter in light and love descends?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet so it is: for duly
there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bitter herbs of earth are
set,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till tempered by the Saviour&rsquo;s prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the Saviour&rsquo;s
life-blood wet,<br />
They turn to sweetness, and drop holy balm,<br />
Soft as imprisoned martyr&rsquo;s deathbed calm.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All turn to sweet&mdash;but
most of all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That bitterest to the lip of
pride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When hopes presumptuous fade and fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or Friendship scorns us, duly
tried,<br />
Or Love, the flower that closes up for fear<br />
When rude and selfish spirits breathe too near.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then like a long-forgotten
strain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes sweeping o&rsquo;er the
heart forlorn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What sunshine hours had taught in vain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> suffering shame and scorn,<br />
As in all lowly hearts he suffers still,<br />
While we triumphant ride and have the world at will.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pierc&egrave;d hands in
vain would hide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His face from rude reproachful
gaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His ears are open to abide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wildest storm the tongue can
raise,<br />
He who with one rough word, some early day,<br />
Their idol world and them shall sweep for aye away.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we by Fancy may
assuage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The festering sore by Fancy
made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down in some lonely hermitage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like wounded pilgrims safely
laid,<br />
Where gentlest breezes whisper souls distressed,<br />
That Love yet lives, and Patience shall find rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O! shame beyond the bitterest
thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That evil spirit ever framed,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sinners know what Jesus wrought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet feel their haughty hearts
untamed&mdash;<br />
That souls in refuge, holding by the Cross,<br />
Should wince and fret at this world&rsquo;s little loss.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of my heart, by Thy last
cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let not Thy blood on earth be
spent&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo, at Thy feet I fainting lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine eyes upon Thy wounds are
bent,<br />
Upon Thy streaming wounds my weary eyes<br />
Wait like the parch&egrave;d earth on April skies.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash me, and dry these bitter
tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O let my heart no further roam,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Thine by vows, and hopes, and fears.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long since&mdash;O call Thy
wanderer home;<br />
To that dear home, safe in Thy wounded side,<br />
Where only broken hearts their sin and shame may hide.</p>
<h3>Easter Eve.</h3>
<blockquote><p>As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I
have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no
water.&nbsp; <i>Zechariah</i> ix. 11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">At</span>
length the worst is o&rsquo;er, and Thou art laid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep in Thy darksome bed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All still and cold beneath yon dreary stone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy sacred form is gone;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Around those lips where power and mercy hung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dews of deaths have clung;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dull earth o&rsquo;er Thee, and Thy foes
around,<br />
Thou sleep&rsquo;st a silent corse, in funeral fetters wound.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep&rsquo;st Thou indeed?
or is Thy spirit fled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At large among the dead?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether in Eden bowers Thy welcome voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wake Abraham to rejoice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or in some drearier scene Thine eye controls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thronging band of souls;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That, as Thy blood won earth, Thine agony<br />
Might set the shadowy realm from sin and sorrow free.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where&rsquo;er Thou
roam&rsquo;st, one happy soul, we know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seen at Thy side in woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Waits on Thy triumphs&mdash;even as all the blest<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With him and Thee shall rest.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each on his cross; by Thee we hang a while,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watching Thy patient smile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till we have learned to say, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
justly done,<br />
Only in glory, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Thy sinful
servant own.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon wilt Thou take us to Thy
tranquil bower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To rest one little hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till Thine elect are numbered, and the grave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call Thee to come and save:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then on Thy bosom borne shall we descend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again with earth to blend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth all refined with bright supernal fires,<br />
Tinctured with holy blood, and winged with pure desires.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile with every son and
saint of Thine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the glorious line,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting by turns beneath Thy sacred feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll hold communion
sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Know them by look and voice, and thank them all<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For helping us in thrall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For words of hope, and bright examples given<br />
To show through moonless skies that there is light in Heaven.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O come that day, when in this
restless heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth shall resign her part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When in the grave with Thee my limbs shall rest,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My soul with Thee be blest!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But stay, presumptuous&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Christ</span> with Thee abides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the rock&rsquo;s dreary
sides:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He from this stone will wring Celestial dew<br />
If but this prisoner&rsquo;s heart he faithful found and
true.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When tears are spent, and
then art left alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ghosts of blessings gone,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Think thou art taken from the cross, and laid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>&rsquo; burial shade;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take Moses&rsquo; rod, the rod of prayer, and
call<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the rocky wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fount of holy blood; and lift on high<br />
Thy grovelling soul that feels so desolate and dry.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoner of Hope thou
art&mdash;look up and sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In hope of promised spring.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the pit his father&rsquo;s darling lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the desert way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And knew not how, but knew his <span
class="smcap">God</span> would save<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en from that living
grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So, buried with our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
we&rsquo;ll chose our eyes<br />
To the decaying world, till Angels bid us rise.</p>
<h3>Easter Day.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their
faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living
among the dead?&nbsp; He is not here, but is risen.&nbsp; <i>St.
Luke</i> xxiv. 5, 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Oh</span>! day of days!
shall hearts set free<br />
No &ldquo;minstrel rapture&rdquo; find for thee?<br />
Thou art this Sun of other days,<br />
They shine by giving back thy rays:</p>
<p class="poetry">Enthron&egrave;d in thy sovereign sphere,<br />
Thou shedd&rsquo;st thy light on all the year;<br />
Sundays by thee more glorious break,<br />
An Easter Day in every week:</p>
<p class="poetry">And week days, following in their train,<br />
The fulness of thy blessing gain,<br />
Till all, both resting soil employ,<br />
Be one Lord&rsquo;s day of holy joy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then wake, my soul, to high desires,<br />
And earlier light thine altar fires:<br />
The World some hours is on her way,<br />
Nor thinks on thee, thou bless&egrave;d day:</p>
<p class="poetry">Or, if she think, it is in scorn:<br />
The vernal light of Easter morn<br />
To her dark gaze no brighter seems<br />
Than Reason&rsquo;s or the Law&rsquo;s pale beams.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Where is your Lord?&rdquo; she scornful
asks:<br />
&ldquo;Where is His hire? we know his tasks;<br />
Sons of a King ye boast to be:<br />
Let us your crowns and treasures see.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">We in the words of Truth reply,<br />
(An angel brought them from this sky,)<br />
&ldquo;Our crown, our treasure is not here,<br />
&rsquo;Tis stored above the highest sphere:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Methinks your wisdom guides amiss,<br />
To seek on earth a Christian&rsquo;s bliss;<br />
We watch not now the lifeless stone;<br />
Our only Lord is risen and gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet e&rsquo;en the lifeless stone is dear<br />
For thoughts of Him who late lay here;<br />
And the base world, now Christ hath died,<br />
Ennobled is and glorified.</p>
<p class="poetry">No more a charnel-house, to fence<br />
The relics of lost innocence,<br />
A vault of ruin and decay;<br />
Th&rsquo; imprisoning stone is rolled away:</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis now a cell, where angels use<br />
To come and go with heavenly news,<br />
And in the ears of mourners say,<br />
&ldquo;Come, see the place where Jesus lay:&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis now a fane, where Love can find<br
/>
Christ everywhere embalmed and shined:<br />
Aye gathering up memorials sweet,<br />
Where&rsquo;er she sets her duteous feet.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! joy to Mary first allowed,<br />
When roused from weeping o&rsquo;er His shroud,<br />
By His own calm, soul-soothing tone,<br />
Breathing her name, as still His own!</p>
<p class="poetry">Joy to the faithful Three renewed,<br />
As their glad errand they pursued!<br />
Happy, who so Christ&rsquo;s word convey,<br />
That he may meet them on their way!</p>
<p class="poetry">So is it still: to holy tears,<br />
In lonely hours, Christ risen appears:<br />
In social hours, who Christ would see<br />
Must turn all tasks to Charity.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; His wistful brow was upward raised,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, like an angel&rsquo;s
train,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The burnished
water blazed.</p>
<p class="poetry">The saint beside the ocean prayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This soldier in his chosen bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where all his eye surveyed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seemed sacred in
that hour.</p>
<p class="poetry">To each unknown his brother&rsquo;s prayer,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet brethren true in dearest love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were they&mdash;and now they
share<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraternal joys
above.</p>
<p class="poetry">There daily through Christ&rsquo;s open gate<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; They see the Gentile spirits press,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brightening their high estate<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With dearer
happiness.</p>
<p class="poetry">What civic wreath for comrades saved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shone ever with such deathless gleam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or when did perils braved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So sweet to
veterans seem?</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Thou</span> first-born of

&nbsp;&nbsp; Pride of the dewy glade,<br />
In vernal green and virgin white,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy vestal robes, arrayed:</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis not because thy drooping form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinks graceful on its nest,<br />
When chilly shades from gathering storm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Affright thy tender breast;</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor for yon river islet wild<br />

Yet mortals doubt, when angels bring<br />

And voices, that forbid to seek<br />

As on their lowly couch they lie,<br />

<h3>First Sunday after Easter.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the
God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel,
to bring you near to Himself?&nbsp; <i>Numbers</i> xvi. 9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">First</span> Father of the
holy seed,<br />
If yet, invoked in hour of need,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou count me for Thine own<br />
Not quite an outcast if I prove,<br />
(Thou joy&rsquo;st in miracles of love),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear, from Thy mercy-throne!</p>
<p class="poetry">Upon Thine altar&rsquo;s horn of gold<br />
Help me to lay my trembling hold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though stained with Christian gore;&mdash;<br />
The blood of souls by Thee redeemed,<br />
But, while I roved or idly dreamed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost to be found no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">For oft, when summer leaves were bright,<br />
And every flower was bathed in light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In sunshine moments past,<br />
My wilful heart would burst away<br />
From where the holy shadow lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where heaven my lot had cast.</p>
<p class="poetry">I thought it scorn with Thee to dwell,<br />
A Hermit in a silent cell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While, gaily sweeping by,<br />
Wild Fancy blew his bugle strain,<br />
And marshalled all his gallant train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the world&rsquo;s wondering eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">I would have joined him&mdash;but as oft<br />
Thy whispered warnings, kind and soft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My better soul confessed.<br />
&ldquo;My servant, let the world alone&mdash;<br />
Safe on the steps of Jesus&rsquo; throne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be tranquil and be blest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Seems it to thee a niggard hand<br />
That nearest Heaven has bade thee stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ark to touch and bear,<br />
With incense of pure heart&rsquo;s desire<br />
To heap the censer&rsquo;s sacred fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The snow-white Ephod wear?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Why should we crave the worldling&rsquo;s
wreath,<br />
On whom the Savour deigned to breathe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To whom His keys were given,<br />
Who lead the choir where angels meet,<br />
With angels&rsquo; food our brethren greet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pour the drink of Heaven?</p>
<p class="poetry">When sorrow all our heart would ask,<br />
We need not shun our daily task,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hide ourselves for calm;<br />
The herbs we seek to heal our woe<br />
Familiar by our pathway grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our common air is balm.</p>
<p class="poetry">Around each pure domestic shrine<br />
Bright flowers of Eden bloom and twine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our hearths are altars all;<br />
The prayers of hungry souls and poor,<br />
Like arm&egrave;d angels at the door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our unseen foes appal.</p>
<p class="poetry">Alms all around and hymns within&mdash;<br />
What evil eye can entrance win<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where guards like these abound?<br />
If chance some heedless heart should roam,<br />
Sure, thought of these will lure it home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere lost in Folly&rsquo;s round.</p>
<p class="poetry">O joys, that sweetest in decay,<br />
Fall not, like withered leaves, away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But with the silent breath<br />
Of violets drooping one by one,<br />
Soon as their fragrant task is done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are wafted high in death!</p>
<h3>Second Sunday after Easter.</h3>
<blockquote><p>He hath said, which heard the words of God, and
knew the knowledge of the Most High, which saw the vision of the
Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: I
shall see Him, but not now; I shall behold Him, but not nigh;
there shall come a Star out at Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise
out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy
all the children at Sheth.&nbsp; <i>Numbers</i> xxiv. 16, 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O <span
class="smcap">for</span> a sculptor&rsquo;s hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou might&rsquo;st take thy stand,<br />
Thy wild hair floating on the eastern breeze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy tranced yet open gaze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed on the desert haze,<br />
As one who deep in heaven some airy pageant sees.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In outline dim and vast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their fearful shadows cast<br />
This giant forms of empires on their way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To ruin: one by one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They tower and they are gone,<br />
Yet in the Prophet&rsquo;s soul the dreams of avarice stay.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sun or star so bright<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the world of light<br />
That they should draw to Heaven his downward eye:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He hears th&rsquo; Almighty&rsquo;s word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sees the angel&rsquo;s sword,<br />
Yet low upon the earth his heart and treasure lie.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! from you argent field,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To him and us revealed,<br />
One gentle Star glides down, on earth to dwell.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chained as they are below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our eyes may see it glow,<br />
And as it mounts again, may track its brightness well.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him it glared afar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A token of wild war,<br />
The banner of his Lord&rsquo;s victorious wrath:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But close to us it gleams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its soothing lustre streams<br />
Around our home&rsquo;s green walls, and on our church-way
path.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the tents abide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which he at distance eyed<br />
Like goodly cedars by the waters spread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While seven red altar-fires<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose up in wavy spires,<br />
Where on the mount he watched his sorceries dark and dread.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched till
morning&rsquo;s ray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On lake and meadow lay,<br />
And willow-shaded streams that silent sweep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the bannered lines,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where by their several signs<br />
The desert-wearied tribes in sight of Canaan sleep.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched till knowledge
came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon his soul like flame,<br />
Not of those magic fires at random caught:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But true Prophetic light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flashed o&rsquo;er him, high and bright,<br />
Flashed once, and died away, and left his darkened thought.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can he choose but
fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who feels his <span class="smcap">God</span> so
near,<br />
That when he fain would curse, his powerless tongue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In blessing only moves?&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! the world he loves<br />
Too close around his heart her tangling veil hath flung.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sceptre and Star divine,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who in Thine inmost shrine<br />
Hash made us worshippers, O claim Thine own;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More than Thy seers we know&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O teach our love to grow<br />
Up to Thy heavenly light, and reap what Thou hast sown.</p>
<h3>Third Sunday after Easter.</h3>
<blockquote><p>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow,
because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the
child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is
born into the world.&nbsp; <i>St. John</i> xvi. 21.</p>
</blockquote>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Well</span> may I guess and feel<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why Autumn should be sad;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But vernal airs should sorrow
heal,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Spring should be gay and glad:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet as along this violet bank I rove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The languid sweetness seems to
choke my breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit me down beside the hazel grove,<br />
And sigh, and half could wish my weariness were death.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
a bright veering cloud<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Grey blossoms twinkle there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warbles around a busy crowd<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of larks in purest air.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shame on the heart that dreams of blessings gone,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or wakes the spectral forms of woe
and crime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When nature sings of joy and hope alone,<br />
Reading her cheerful lesson in her own sweet time.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor
let the proud heart say,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In her self-torturing hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The travail pangs must have their
way,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The aching brow must lower.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To us long since the glorious Child is born<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our throes should be forgot, or
only seem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a sad vision told for joy at morn,<br />
For joy that we have waked and found it but a dream.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious
to all thought<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A mother&rsquo;s prime of bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When to her eager lips is
brought<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her infant&rsquo;s thrilling kiss.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O never shall it set, the sacred light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which dawns that moment on her
tender gaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eternal distance blending bright<br />
Her darling&rsquo;s hope and hers, for love and joy and
praise.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
need for her to weep<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like Thracian wives of yore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save when in rapture still and
deep<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her thankful heart runs o&rsquo;er.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They mourned to trust their treasure on the main,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure of the storm, unknowing of
their guide:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to her the peril and the pain,<br />
For well she knows the bonus where they may safely hide.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She
joys that one is born<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Into a world forgiven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Father&rsquo;s household to
adorn,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And dwell with her in Heaven.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So have I seen, in Spring&rsquo;s bewitching
hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the glad Earth is offering
all her best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some gentle maid bend o&rsquo;er a cherished
flower,<br />
And wish it worthier on a Parent&rsquo;s heart to rest.</p>
<h3>Fourth Sunday after Easter.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient
for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will
not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto
you.&nbsp; <i>St. John</i> xvi 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">My</span> Saviour, can it
ever be<br />
That I should gain by losing Thee?<br />
The watchful mother tarries nigh,<br />
Though sleep have closed her infant&rsquo;s eye;<br />
For should he wake, and find her gone.<br />
She knows she could not bear his moan.<br />
But I am weaker than a child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Thou art more than mother dear;<br />
Without Thee Heaven were but a wild;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I live without Thee here!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis good for you, that I should
go,<br />
&ldquo;You lingering yet awhile below;&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis Thine own gracious promise, Lord!<br />
Thy saints have proved the faithful word,<br />
When heaven&rsquo;s bright boundless avenue<br />
Far opened on their eager view,<br />
And homeward to Thy Father&rsquo;s throne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still lessening, brightening on their sight,<br />
Thy shadowy car went soaring on;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They tracked Thee up th&rsquo; abyss of light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou bidd&rsquo;st rejoice; they dare not
mourn,<br />
But to their home in gladness turn,<br />
Their home and God&rsquo;s, that favoured place,<br />
Where still He shines on Abraham&rsquo;s race,<br />
In prayers and blessings there to wait<br />
Like suppliants at their Monarch&rsquo;s gate,<br />
Who bent with bounty rare to aid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The splendours of His crowning day,<br />
Keeps back awhile His largess, made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More welcome for that brief delay:</p>
<p class="poetry">In doubt they wait, but not unblest;<br />
They doubt not of their Master&rsquo;s rest,<br />
Nor of the gracious will of Heaven&mdash;<br />
Who gave His Son, sure all has given&mdash;<br />
But in ecstatic awe they muse<br />
What course the genial stream may choose,<br />
And far and wide their fancies rove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to their height of wonder strain,<br />
What secret miracle of love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should make their Saviour&rsquo;s going gain.</p>
<p class="poetry">The days of hope and prayer are past,<br />
The day of comfort dawns at last,<br />
The everlasting gates again<br />
Roll back, and, lo! a royal train&mdash;<br />
From the far depth of light once more<br />
The floods of glory earthward pour:<br />
They part like shower-drops in mid air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But ne&rsquo;er so soft fell noon-tide shower,<br />
Nor evening rainbow gleamed so fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To weary swains in parch&egrave;d bower.</p>
<p class="poetry">Swiftly and straight each tongue of flame<br />
Through cloud and breeze unwavering came,<br />
And darted to its place of rest<br />
On some meek brow of Jesus blest.<br />
Nor fades it yet, that living gleam,<br />
And still those lambent lightnings stream;<br />
Where&rsquo;er the Lord is, there are they;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In every heart that gives them room,<br />
They light His altar every day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Zeal to inflame, and vice consume.</p>
<p class="poetry">Soft as the plumes of Jesus&rsquo; Dove<br />
They nurse the soul to heavenly love;<br />
The struggling spark of good within,<br />
Just smothered in the strife of sin,<br />
They quicken to a timely glow,<br />
The pure flame spreading high and low.<br />
Said I, that prayer and hope were o&rsquo;er?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, bless&egrave;d Spirit! but by Thee<br />
The Church&rsquo;s prayer finds wings to soar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Church&rsquo;s hope finds eyes to see.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, fainting soul, arise and sing;<br />
Mount, but be sober on the wing;<br />
Mount up, for Heaven is won by prayer,<br />
Be sober, for thou art not there;<br />
Till Death the weary spirit free,<br />
Thy God hath said, &rsquo;Tis good for thee<br />
To walk by faith and not by sight:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take it on trust a little while;<br />
Soon shalt thou read the mystery right<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the full sunshine of His smile.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or if thou yet more knowledge crave,<br />
Ask thine own heart, that willing slave<br />
To all that works thee woe or harm<br />
Shouldst thou not need some mighty charm<br />
To win thee to thy Saviour&rsquo;s side,<br />
Though He had deigned with thee to bide?<br />
The Spirit must stir the darkling deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dove must settle on the Cross,<br />
Else we should all sin on or sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Christ in sight, turning our gain to loss.</p>
<h3>Fifth Sunday After Easter.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ROGATION SUNDAY.</span></h3>
<blockquote><p>And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have
destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.&nbsp;
<i>Deuteronomy</i> ix. 20.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Now</span> is there solemn
pause in earth and heaven;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conqueror now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His bonds hath riven,<br />
And Angels wonder why He stays below:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet hath not man his lesson learned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How endless love should be returned.</p>
<p class="poetry">Deep is the silence as of summer noon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a soft shower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will trickle soon,<br />
A gracious rain, freshening the weary bower&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O sweetly then far off is heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clear note of some lonely bird.</p>
<p class="poetry">So let Thy turtle-dove&rsquo;s sad call
arise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In doubt and fear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through darkening skies,<br />
And pierce, O Lord, Thy justly-seal&egrave;d ear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where on the house-top, all night long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She trills her widowed, faltering song.</p>
<p class="poetry">Teach her to know and love her hour of
prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And evermore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As faith grows rare,<br />
Unlock her heart, and offer all its store<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In holier love and humbler vows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As suits a lost returning spouse.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not as at first, but with intenser cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the mount<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She now must lie,<br />
Till Thy dear love to blot the sad account<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of her rebellious race be won,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pitying the mother in the son.</p>
<p class="poetry">But chiefly (for she knows Thee angered
worst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By holiest things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Profaned and curst),<br />
Chiefly for Aaron&rsquo;s seed she spreads her wings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If but one leaf she may from Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Win of the reconciling tree.</p>
<p class="poetry">For what shall heal, when holy water banes!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or who may guide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er desert plains<br />
Thy loved yet sinful people wandering wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Aaron&rsquo;s hand unshrinking mould<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An idol form of earthly gold?</p>
<p class="poetry">Therefore her tears are bitter, and as deep<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her boding sigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As, while men sleep,<br />
Sad-hearted mothers heave, that wakeful lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To muse upon some darling child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Roaming in youth&rsquo;s uncertain wild.</p>
<p class="poetry">Therefore on fearful dreams her inward sight<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is fain to dwell&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What lurid light<br />
Shall the last darkness of the world dispel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mediator in His wrath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Descending down the lightning&rsquo;s path.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet, yet awhile, offended Saviour, pause,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In act to break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine outraged laws,<br />
O spare Thy rebels for Thine own dear sake;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Withdraw Thine hand, nor dash to earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The covenant of our second birth.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis forfeit like the first&mdash;we own
it all&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet for love&rsquo;s sake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it not fall;<br />
But at Thy touch let veil&egrave;d hearts awake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That nearest to Thine altar lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet least of holy things descry.</p>
<p class="poetry">Teacher of teachers!&nbsp; Priest of priests!
from Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweet strong prayer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must rise, to free<br />
First Levi, then all Israel, from the snare.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art our Moses out of sight&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak for us, or we perish quite.</p>

Chants her glad matins in the leafy arch,<br />

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul is
envious of mine eye,<br />
That it should soar and glide with thee so fast,<br />

My Saviour&rsquo;s pathway to His home above.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, when
I reach the point where earth<br />
Melts into nothing from th&rsquo; uncumbered sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven will o&rsquo;ercome th&rsquo; attraction of

every vassal star,<br />
All space, beyond the soar of angel wings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait on His word: and yet He stays His car<br />
For every sigh a contrite suppliant brings.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listens
to the silent tear<br />
For all the anthems of the boundless sky&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shall our dreams of music bar our ear<br />
To His soul-piercing voice for ever nigh?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay,
gracious Saviour&mdash;but as now<br />
Our thoughts have traced Thee to Thy glory-throne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So help us evermore with thee to bow<br />
Where human sorrow breathes her lowly moan.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not
stand to gaze too long,<br />
Though on unfolding Heaven our gaze we bend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where lost behind the bright angelic throng<br />
We see <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> entering triumph
slow ascend.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No fear but
we shall soon behold,<br />
Faster than now it fades, that gleam revive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When issuing from his cloud of fiery gold<br />
Our wasted frames feel the true sun, and live.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shall
we see Thee as Thou art,<br />
For ever fixed in no unfruitful gaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But such as lifts the new-created heart,<br />
Age after age, in worthier love and praise.</p>

A day of wrath and not of grace;<br />

Softer than gale at morning prime<br />

Now gently light, a glorious crown,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; At that high warning start;<br />
Conscience gives back th&rsquo; appalling tone;<br />

<p class="poetry">It fills the Church of God; it fills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sinful world around;<br />
Only in stubborn hearts and wills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No place for it is found.</p>
<p class="poetry">To other strains our souls are set:<br />

Steal on, and spare the giant sway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The crash of tower and grove.</p>
<p class="poetry">Far opening down some woodland deep<br />
In their own quiet glade should sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The relics dear to thought,<br />
And wild-flower wreaths from side to side<br />
Their waving tracery hang, to hide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What ruthless Time has wrought.</p>
<p class="poetry">Such are the visions green and sweet<br />
That o&rsquo;er the wistful fancy fleet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Asia&rsquo;s sea-like plain,<br />
Where slowly, round his isles of sand,<br />
Euphrates through the lonely land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Winds toward the pearly main.</p>
<p class="poetry">Slumber is there, but not of rest;<br />
There her forlorn and weary nest<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The traveller on his round.</p>
<p class="poetry">What shapeless form, half lost on high,<br />
Half seen against the evening sky,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies fallen imperial Pride?</p>
<p class="poetry">With half-closed eye a lion there<br />
Is basking in his noontide lair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or prowls in twilight gloom.<br />
The golden city&rsquo;s king he seems,<br />
Such as in old prophetic dreams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sprang from rough ocean&rsquo;s womb.</p>
<p class="poetry">But where are now his eagle wings,<br />
That sheltered erst a thousand kings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiding the glorious sky<br />
From half the nations, till they own<br />
No holier name, no mightier throne?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That vision is gone by.</p>
<p class="poetry">Quenched is the golden statue&rsquo;s ray,<br

The breath of heaven has blown away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What toiling earth had piled,<br />
Scattering wise heart and crafty hand,<br />
As breezes strew on ocean&rsquo;s sand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fabrics of a child.</p>
<p class="poetry">Divided thence through every age<br />
Thy rebels, Lord, their warfare wage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hoarse and jarring all<br />
Mount up their heaven-assailing cries<br />
To Thy bright watchmen in the skies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Babel&rsquo;s shattered wall.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thrice only since, with blended might<br />
The nations on that haughty height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have met to scale the Heaven:<br />
Thrice only might a Seraph&rsquo;s look<br />
A moment&rsquo;s shade of sadness brook&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such power to guilt was given.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now the fierce bear and leopard keen<br />
Are perished as they ne&rsquo;er had been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oblivion is their home:<br />
Ambition&rsquo;s boldest dream and last<br />
Must melt before the clarion blast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sounds the dirge of Rome.</p>
<p class="poetry">Heroes and kings, obey the charm,<br />
Withdraw the proud high-reaching arm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an oath on high:<br />
That ne&rsquo;er on brow of mortal birth<br />
Shall blend again the crowns of earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor in according cry</p>
<p class="poetry">Her many voices mingling own<br />
One tyrant Lord, one idol throne:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But to His triumphs soon<br />
<i>He</i> shall descend, who rules above,<br />
And the pure language of His love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All tongues of men shall tune.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor let Ambition heartless mourn;<br />
When Babel&rsquo;s very ruins burn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her high desires may breathe;&mdash;<br />
O&rsquo;ercome thyself, and thou mayst share<br />
With Christ His Father&rsquo;s throne, and wear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world&rsquo;s imperial wreath.</p>

Hovering His gracious brow above,<br />

Back to His task of woe and tears,<br />
Unmurmuring through the world to roam<br />
With not a wish or thought at home:&mdash;</p>

He to His Father gently yield<br />
The breath that our redemption sealed:&mdash;</p>

Here over shattered walls dank weeds are growing,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like oaks and cedars all around<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The giant corses strew the
ground,<br />
And haughty Jericho&rsquo;s cloud-piercing wall<br />
Lies where it sank at Joshua&rsquo;s trumpet call.</p>
<p class="poetry">These are not scenes for pastoral dance at
even,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For moonlight rovings in the fragrant glades,<br />
Soft slumbers in the open eye of Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the listless joy of summer shades.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We in the midst of ruins live,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which every hour dread warning
give,<br />
Nor may our household vine or fig-tree hide<br />
The broken arches of old Canaan&rsquo;s pride.</p>
<p class="poetry">Where is the sweet repose of hearts

land before ye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is open&mdash;win your way, and take your
rest.&rdquo;<br />
So sounds our war-note; but our path of glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By many a cloud is darkened and unblest:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And daily as we downward glide,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s ebbing stream on
either side<br />
Shows at each turn some mouldering hope or joy,<br />
The Man seems following still the funeral of the Boy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Open our eyes, Thou Sun of life and
gladness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That we may see that glorious world of Thine!<br />
It shines for us in vain, while drooping sadness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enfolds us here like mist: come Power benign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Touch our chilled hearts with
vernal smile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our wintry course do Thou
beguile,<br />
Nor by the wayside ruins let us mourn,<br />
Who have th&rsquo; eternal towers for our appointed bourne.</p>

They mantle round the Sun for love.</p>

Hope against mope, in love&rsquo;s dear task,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spite of all dark offence.<br />
If they who hate the trespass most,<br />
Yet, when all other love is lost,<br />
Love the poor sinner, marvel not;<br />
Christ&rsquo;s mark outwears the rankest blot.</p>
<p class="poetry">No distance breaks this tie of blood;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brothers are brothers evermore;<br />
Nor wrong, nor wrath of deadliest mood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That magic may o&rsquo;erpower;<br />
Oft, ere the common source be known,<br />
The kindred drops will claim their own,<br />
And throbbing pulses silently<br />
Move heart towards heart by sympathy.</p>
<p class="poetry">So it is with true Christian hearts;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their mutual share in Jesus&rsquo; blood<br />
An everlasting bond imparts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of holiest brotherhood:<br />
Oh! might we all our lineage prove,<br />
Give and forgive, do good and love,<br />
By soft endearments in kind strife<br />
Lightening the load of daily life.</p>
<p class="poetry">There is much need; for not as yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we in shelter or repose,<br />
The holy house is still beset<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With leaguer of stern foes;<br />
Wild thoughts within, bad men without,<br />
All evil spirits round about,<br />
Are banded in unblest device,<br />
To spoil Love&rsquo;s earthly paradise.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then draw we nearer day by day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each to his brethren, all to God;<br />
Let the world take us as she may,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We must not change our road;<br />
Not wondering, though in grief, to find<br />
The martyr&rsquo;s foe still keep her mind;<br />
But fixed to hold Love&rsquo;s banner fast,<br />
And by submission win at last.</p>
<h3>Third Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>There is joy in the presence of the angels of God
over one sinner that repenteth.&nbsp; <i>St. Luke</i> xv. 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">hateful</span> spell of
Sin! when friends are nigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make stern Memory tell her tale unsought,<br />
And raise accusing shades of hours gone by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To come between us and all kindly thought!</p>
<p class="poetry">Chilled at her touch, the self-reproaching
soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flies from the heart and home she dearest loves,<br
/>
To where lone mountains tower, or billows roll,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or to your endless depth, ye solemn groves.</p>
<p class="poetry">In vain: the averted cheek in loneliest dell<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is conscious of a gaze it cannot bear,<br />
The leaves that rustle near us seem to tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our heart&rsquo;s sad secret to the silent air.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor is the dream untrue; for all around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heavens are watching with their thousand
eyes,<br />
We cannot pass our guardian angel&rsquo;s bound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resigned or sullen, he will hear our sighs.</p>
<p class="poetry">He in the mazes of the budding wood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is near, and mourns to see our thankless glance<br
/>
Dwell coldly, where the fresh green earth is strewed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the first flowers that lead the vernal
dance.</p>
<p class="poetry">In wasteful bounty showered, they smile
unseen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unseen by man&mdash;but what if purer sprights<br />
By moonlight o&rsquo;er their dewy bosoms lean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To adore the Father of all gentle lights?</p>
<p class="poetry">If such there be, O grief and shame to think<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sight of thee should overcloud their joy,<br />
A new-born soul, just waiting on the brink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of endless life, yet wrapt in earth&rsquo;s
annoy!</p>
<p class="poetry">O turn, and be thou turned! the selfish
tear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In bitter thoughts of low-born care begun,<br />
Let it flow on, but flow refined and clear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The turbid waters brightening as they run.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let it flow on, till all thine earthly heart<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In penitential drops have ebbed away,<br />
Then fearless turn where Heaven hath set thy part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor shudder at the Eye that saw thee stray.</p>
<p class="poetry">O lost and found! all gentle souls below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their dearest welcome shall prepare, and prove<br />
Such joy o&rsquo;er thee, as raptured seraphs know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who learn their lesson at the Throne of Love.</p>
<h3>Fourth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>For the earnest expectation of the creature
waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.&nbsp; For the
creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by the
reason of Him who hath subjected the same in hope, because the
creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of
God.&nbsp; For we know that the whole creation groaneth and
travaileth in pain together until now.&nbsp; <i>Romans</i> viii
19&ndash;22.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not then a
poet&rsquo;s dream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An idle vaunt of song,<br />
Such as beneath the moon&rsquo;s soft gleam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On vacant fancies throng;</p>
<p class="poetry">Which bids us see in heaven and earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all fair things around,<br />
Strong yearnings for a blest new birth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sinless glories crowned;</p>
<p class="poetry">Which bids us hear, at each sweet pause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From care and want and toil,<br />
When dewy eve her curtain draws<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the day&rsquo;s turmoil,</p>
<p class="poetry">In the low chant of wakeful birds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the deep weltering flood,<br />
In whispering leaves, these solemn words&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;God made us all for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">All true, all faultless, all in tune<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation&rsquo;s wondrous choir,<br />
Opened in mystic unison<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To last till time expire.</p>
<p class="poetry">And still it lasts; by day and night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With one consenting voice,<br />
All hymn Thy glory, Lord, aright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All worship and rejoice.</p>
<p class="poetry">Man only mars the sweet accord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;erpowering with &ldquo;harsh din&rdquo;<br
/>
The music of Thy works and word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ill matched with grief and sin.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sin is with man at morning break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through the livelong day<br />
Deafens the ear that fain would wake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Nature&rsquo;s simple lay.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when eve&rsquo;s silent footfall steals<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the eastern sky,<br />
And one by one to earth reveals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those purer fires on high,</p>
<p class="poetry">When one by one each human sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dies on the awful ear,<br />
Then Nature&rsquo;s voice no more is drowned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She speaks, and we must hear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then pours she on the Christian heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That warning still and deep,<br />
At which high spirits of old would start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en from their Pagan sleep.</p>
<p class="poetry">Just guessing, through their murky blind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Few, faint, and baffling sight,<br />
Streaks of a brighter heaven behind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A cloudless depth of light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Such thoughts, the wreck of Paradise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through many a dreary age,<br />
Upbore whate&rsquo;er of good and wise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet lived in bard or sage:</p>
<p class="poetry">They marked what agonizing throes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shook the great mother&rsquo;s womb:<br />
But Reason&rsquo;s spells might not disclose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gracious birth to come:</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor could the enchantress Hope forecast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s secret love and power;<br />
The travail pangs of Earth must last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till her appointed hour.</p>
<p class="poetry">The hour that saw from opening heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Redeeming glory stream,<br />
Beyond the summer hues of even,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the mid-day beam.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thenceforth, to eyes of high desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The meanest thing below,<br />
As with a seraph&rsquo;s robe of fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Invested, burn and glow:</p>
<p class="poetry">The rod of Heaven has touched them all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The word from Heaven is spoken:<br />
&ldquo;Rise, shine, and sing, thou captive thrall;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are not thy fetters broken?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The God Who hallowed thee and blest,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pronouncing thee all good&mdash;<br />
Hath He not all thy wrongs redrest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all thy bliss renewed?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Why mourn&rsquo;st thou still as one
bereft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that th&rsquo; eternal Son<br />
His bless&egrave;d home in Heaven hath left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make thee all His own?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou mourn&rsquo;st because sin lingers
still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Christ&rsquo;s new heaven and earth;<br />
Because our rebel works and will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stain our immortal birth:</p>
<p class="poetry">Because, as Love and Prayer grow cold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Saviour hides His face,<br />
And worldlings blot the temple&rsquo;s gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With uses vile and base.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hence all thy groans and travail pains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, till thy God return,<br />
In Wisdom&rsquo;s ear thy blithest strains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh Nature, seem to mourn.</p>
<h3>Fifth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And Simon answering said unto Him, Master, we have
toiled all the night, and have taken nothing; nevertheless at Thy
word I will let down the net.&nbsp; And when they had this done,
they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net
brake.&nbsp; <i>St. Luke</i> v. 5, 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The livelong night we&rsquo;ve toiled in
vain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But at Thy gracious word<br />
I will let down the net again:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do Thou Thy will, O Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So spake the weary fisher, spent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With bootless darkling toil,<br />
Yet on his Master&rsquo;s bidding bent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For love and not for spoil.</p>
<p class="poetry">So day by day and week by week,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In sad and weary thought,<br />
They muse, whom God hath set to seek<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The souls His Christ hath bought.</p>
<p class="poetry">For not upon a tranquil lake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our pleasant task we ply,<br />
Where all along our glistening wake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The softest moonbeams lie;</p>
<p class="poetry">Where rippling wave and dashing oar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our midnight chant attend,<br />
Or whispering palm-leaves from the shore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With midnight silence blend.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet thoughts of peace, ye may not last:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too soon some ruder sound<br />
Calls us from where ye soar so fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to our earthly round.</p>
<p class="poetry">For wildest storms our ocean sweep:&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; No anchor but the Cross<br />
Might hold: and oft the thankless deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turns all our toil to loss.</p>
<p class="poetry">Full many a dreary anxious hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We watch our nets alone<br />
In drenching spray, and driving shower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hear the night-bird&rsquo;s moan:</p>
<p class="poetry">At morn we look, and nought is there;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sad dawn of cheerless day!<br />
Who then from pining and despair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sickening heart can stay?</p>
<p class="poetry">There is a stay&mdash;and we are strong;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Master is at hand,<br />
To cheer our solitary song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And guide us to the strand.</p>
<p class="poetry">In His own time; but yet a while<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our bark at sea must ride;<br />
Cast after cast, by force or guile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All waters must be tried:</p>
<p class="poetry">By blameless guile or gentle force,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As when He deigned to teach<br />
(The lode-star of our Christian course)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon this sacred beach.</p>
<p class="poetry">Should e&rsquo;er thy wonder-working grace<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Triumph by our weak arm,<br />
Let not our sinful fancy trace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Aught human in the charm:</p>
<p class="poetry">To our own nets ne&rsquo;er bow we down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest on the eternal shore<br />
The angels, while oar draught they own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reject us evermore:</p>
<p class="poetry">Or, if for our unworthiness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toil, prayer, and watching fail,<br />
In disappointment Thou canst bless,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So love at heart prevail.</p>
<h3>Sixth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the
Lord.&nbsp; And Nathan said unto David, The Lord also hath put
away thy sin; thou shalt not die.&nbsp; 2 <i>Samuel</i> xii.
13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">When</span> bitter thoughts, of conscience born,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With sinners wake at morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When from our restless couch we start,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With fevered lips and withered heart,<br />
Where is the spell to charm those mists away,<br />
And make new morning in that darksome day?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One draught of spring&rsquo;s delicious air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One steadfast thought, that <span
class="smcap">God</span> is there.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are Thy wonders, hourly
wrought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou Lord of time and thought,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lifting and lowering souls at will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crowding a world of good or ill<br />
Into a moment&rsquo;s vision; e&rsquo;en as light<br />
Mounts o&rsquo;er a cloudy ridge, and all is bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From west to east one thrilling ray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning a wintry world to May.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would&rsquo;st thou the pangs
of guilt assuage?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo! here an open page,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where heavenly mercy shines as free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Written in balm, sad heart, for thee.<br />
Never so fast, in silent April shower,<br />
Flushed into green the dry and leafless bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As Israel&rsquo;s crown&egrave;d mourner felt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dull hard stone within him melt.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absolver saw the mighty
grief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hastened with
relief;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord forgives; thou shalt not
die:&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas gently spoke, yet heard on high,<br />
And all the band of angels, used to sing<br />
In heaven, accordant to his raptured string,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who many a month had turned away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With veil&egrave;d eyes, nor owned his lay,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now spread their wings, and
throng around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the glad mournful sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And welcome, with bright open face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The broken heart to love&rsquo;s embrace.<br />
The rock is smitten, and to future years<br />
Springs ever fresh the tide of holy tears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And holy music, whispering peace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till time and sin together cease.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There drink: and when ye are
at rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that free Spirit blest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who to the contrite can dispense,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The princely heart of innocence,<br />
If ever, floating from faint earthly lyre,<br />
Was wafted to your soul one high desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By all the trembling hope ye feel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Think on the minstrel as ye kneel:</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think on the shame, that
dreadful hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When tears shall have no power,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should his own lay th&rsquo; accuser prove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cold while he kindled others&rsquo; love:<br />
And let your prayer for charity arise,<br />
That his own heart may hear his melodies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a true voice to him may cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy <span class="smcap">God</span>
forgives&mdash;thou shalt not die.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Seventh Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread
here in the wilderness?&nbsp; <i>St. Mark</i> viii. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Go</span>
not away, thou weary soul:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven has in store a precious dole<br />
Here on Bethsaida&rsquo;s cold and darksome height,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where over rocks and sands arise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proud Sirion in the northern skies,<br />
And Tabor&rsquo;s lonely peak, &rsquo;twixt thee and noonday
light.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far below,
Gennesaret&rsquo;s main<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spreads many a mile of liquid plain,<br />
(Though all seem gathered in one eager bound,)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then narrowing cleaves you palmy lea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards that deep sulphureous sea,<br />
Where five proud cities lie, by one dire sentence drowned.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landscape of fear! yet, weary
heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou need&rsquo;st not in thy gloom depart,<br />
Nor fainting turn to seek thy distant home:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweetly thy sickening throbs are eyed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the kind Saviour at thy side;<br />
For healing and for balm e&rsquo;en now thine hour is come.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No fiery wing is seen to
glide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No cates ambrosial are supplied,<br />
But one poor fisher&rsquo;s rude and scanty store<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is all He asks (and more than needs)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who men and angels daily feeds,<br />
And stills the wailing sea-bird on the hungry shore.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feast is o&rsquo;er, the
guests are gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And over all that upland lone<br />
The breeze of eve sweeps wildly as of old&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But far unlike the former dreams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart&rsquo;s sweet moonlight softly gleams<br
/>
Upon life&rsquo;s varied view, so joyless erst and cold.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mountain travellers in the
night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When heaven by fits is dark and bright,<br />
Pause listening on the silent heath, and hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor trampling hoof nor tinkling bell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then bolder scale the rugged fell,<br />
Conscious the more of One, ne&rsquo;er seen, yet ever near:</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the tones of rapture
gay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the lorn ear, die quite away,<br />
The lonely world seems lifted nearer heaven;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seen daily, yet unmarked before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth&rsquo;s common paths are strewn all
o&rsquo;er<br />
With flowers of pensive hope, the wreath of man forgiven.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low sweet tones of
Nature&rsquo;s lyre<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more on listless ears expire,<br />
Nor vainly smiles along the shady way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The primrose in her vernal nest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor unlamented sink to rest<br />
Sweet roses one by one, nor autumn leaves decay.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s not a star the
heaven can show,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a cottage-hearth below,<br />
But feeds with solace kind the willing soul&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Men love us, or they need our love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Freely they own, or heedless prove<br />
The curse of lawless hearts, the joy of self-control.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rouse thee from
desponding sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor by the wayside lingering weep,<br />
Nor fear to seek Him farther in the wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose love can turn earth&rsquo;s worst and least<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into a conqueror&rsquo;s royal feast:<br />
Thou wilt not be untrue, thou shalt not be beguiled.</p>
<h3>Eight Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the
word of the Lord.&nbsp; 1 <i>King</i> xiii. 26.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Prophet</span> of God,
arise and take<br />
With thee the words of wrath divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The scourge of Heaven, to shake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er yon apostate shrine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Where Angels down the lucid stair<br />
Came hovering to our sainted sires<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in the twilight, glare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heathen&rsquo;s wizard fires.</p>
<p class="poetry">Go, with thy voice the altar rend,<br />

But trace not o&rsquo;er the former way,<br />

Where on the lonely woodland road<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The festal warblings flowed;</p>
<p class="poetry">Where maidens to the Queen of Heaven<br />
Wove the gay dance round oak or palm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or breathed their vows at even<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hymns as soft as balm.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or thee, perchance, a darker spell<br />
Enthralls: the smooth stones of the flood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By mountain grot or fell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pollute with infant&rsquo;s blood;</p>
<p class="poetry">The giant altar on the rock,<br />
The cavern whence the timbrel&rsquo;s call<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Affrights the wandering flock:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou long&rsquo;st to search them all.</p>
<p class="poetry">Trust not the dangerous path again&mdash;<br />
O forward step and lingering will!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O loved and warned in vain!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wilt thou perish still?</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy message given, thine home in sight,<br />
To the forbidden feast return?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yield to the false delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy better soul could spurn?</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas, my brother! round thy tomb<br />
In sorrow kneeling, and in fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We read the Pastor&rsquo;s doom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who speaks and will not hear.</p>
<p class="poetry">The grey-haired saint may fail at last,<br />
The surest guide a wanderer prove;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Death only binds us fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the bright shore of love.</p>
<h3>Ninth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> troublous days of
anguish and rebuke,<br />
While sadly round them Israel&rsquo;s children look,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their eyes fail for waiting on their Lord:<br />
While underneath each awful arch of green,<br />
On every mountain-top, God&rsquo;s chosen scene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of pure heart-worship, Baal is adored:</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis well, true hearts should for a time
retire<br />
To holy ground, in quiet to aspire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards promised regions of serener grace;<br />
On Horeb, with Elijah, let us lie,<br />
Where all around on mountain, sand, and sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s chariot wheels have left distinctest
trace;</p>
<p class="poetry">There, if in jealousy and strong disdain<br />
We to the sinner&rsquo;s God of sin complain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Untimely seeking here the peace of Heaven&mdash;<br
/>
&ldquo;It is enough.&nbsp; O Lord! now let me die<br />
E&rsquo;en as my fathers did: for what am I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I should stand where they have vainly
striven?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Perhaps our God may of our conscience ask,<br

&ldquo;What doest thou here frail wanderer from thy task?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where hast thou left those few sheep in the
wild?&rdquo;<br />
Then should we plead our heart&rsquo;s consuming pain,<br />
At sight of ruined altars, prophets slain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And God&rsquo;s own ark with blood of souls
defiled;</p>
<p class="poetry">He on the rock may bid us stand, and see<br />
The outskirts of His march of mystery,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His endless warfare with man&rsquo;s wilful
heart;<br />
First, His great Power He to the sinner shows<br />
Lo! at His angry blast the rocks unclose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to their base the trembling mountains part</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet the Lord is not here: &rsquo;Tis not by
Power<br />
He will be known&mdash;but darker tempests lower;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, sullen heavings vex the labouring ground:<br
/>
Perhaps His Presence thro&rsquo; all depth and height,<br />
Best of all gems that deck His crown of light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The haughty eye may dazzle and confound.</p>
<p class="poetry">God is not in the earthquake; but behold<br />
From Sinai&rsquo;s caves are bursting, as of old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The flames of His consuming jealous ire.<br />
Woe to the sinner should stern Justice prove<br />
His chosen attribute;&mdash;but He in love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hastes to proclaim, &ldquo;God is not in the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The storm is o&rsquo;er&mdash;and hark! a still
small voice<br />
Steals on the ear, to say, Jehovah&rsquo;s choice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is ever with the soft, meek, tender soul;<br />
By soft, meek, tender ways He loves to draw<br />
The sinner, startled by His ways of awe:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is our Lord, and not where thunders roll.</p>
<p class="poetry">Back, then, complainer; loath thy life no
more,<br />
Nor deem thyself upon a desert shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the rocks the nearer prospect close.<br />
Yet in fallen Israel are there hearts and eyes<br />
That day by day in prayer like thine arise;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou know&rsquo;st them not, but their Creator
knows.</p>
<p class="poetry">Go, to the world return, nor fear to cast<br />
Thy bread upon the waters, sure at last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In joy to find it after many days.<br />
The work be thine, the fruit thy children&rsquo;s part:<br />
Choose to believe, not see: sight tempts the heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From sober walking in true Gospel ways.</p>
<h3>Tenth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And when He was come near, He beheld the city, and
wept over it.&nbsp; <i>St. Luke</i> xix. 41.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Why</span> doth my Saviour
weep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At sight of Sion&rsquo;s bowers?<br />
Shows it not fair from yonder steep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gorgeous crown of towers?<br />
Mark well His holy pains:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not in pride or scorn,<br />
That Israel&rsquo;s King with sorrow stains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His own triumphal morn.</p>
<p class="poetry">It is not that His soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is wandering sadly on,<br />
In thought how soon at death&rsquo;s dark goal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their course will all be run,<br />
Who now are shouting round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hosanna to their chief;<br />
No thought like this in Him is found,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This were a Conquerer&rsquo;s grief.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or doth He feel the Cross<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Already in His heart,<br />
The pain, the shame, the scorn, the loss?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Feel e&rsquo;en His God depart?<br />
No: though He knew full well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The grief that then shall be&mdash;<br />
The grief that angels cannot tell&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our God in agony.</p>
<p class="poetry">It is not thus He mourns;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such might be martyr&rsquo;s tears,<br />
When his last lingering look he turns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On human hopes and fears;<br />
But hero ne&rsquo;er or saint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The secret load might know,<br />
With which His spirit waxeth faint;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His is a Saviour&rsquo;s woe.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;If thou had&rsquo;st known, e&rsquo;en
thou,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At least in this thy day,<br />
The message of thy peace! but now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis passed for aye away:<br />
Now foes shall trench thee round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lay thee even with earth,<br />
And dash thy children to the ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy glory and thy mirth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And doth the Saviour weep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over His people&rsquo;s sin,<br />
Because we will not let Him keep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The souls He died to win?<br />
Ye hearts, that love the Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If at this, sight ye burn,<br />
See that in thought, in deed, in word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye hate what made Him mourn.</p>
<h3>Eleventh Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Is it a time to receive money, and to receive
garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and
menservants, and maidservants?&nbsp; 2 <i>Kings</i> v. 26.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Is</span> this a time to
plant and build,<br />
Add house to house, and field to field,<br />
When round our walls the battle lowers,<br />
When mines are hid beneath our towers,<br />
And watchful foes are stealing round<br />
To search and spoil the holy ground?</p>
<p class="poetry">Is this a time for moonlight dreams<br />
Of love and home by mazy streams,<br />
For Fancy with her shadowy toys,<br />
A&euml;rial hopes and pensive joys,<br />
While souls are wandering far and wide,<br />
And curses swarm on every side?</p>
<p class="poetry">No&mdash;rather steel thy melting heart<br />
To act the martyr&rsquo;s sternest part,<br />
To watch, with firm unshrinking eye,<br />
Thy darling visions as thy die,<br />
Till all bright hopes, and hues of day,<br />
Have faded into twilight gray.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes&mdash;let them pass without a sigh,<br />
And if the world seem dull and dry,<br />
If long and sad thy lonely hours,<br />
And winds have rent thy sheltering bowers,<br />
Bethink thee what thou art and where,<br />
A sinner in a life of care.</p>
<p class="poetry">The fire of God is soon to fall<br />
(Thou know&rsquo;st it) on this earthly ball;<br />
Full many a soul, the price of blood,<br />
Marked by th&rsquo; Almighty&rsquo;s hand for good,<br />
To utter death that hour shall sweep&mdash;<br />
And will the saints in Heaven dare weep?</p>
<p class="poetry">Then in His wrath shall <span
class="smcap">God</span> uproot<br />
The trees He set, for lack of fruit,<br />
And drown in rude tempestuous blaze<br />
The towers His hand had deigned to raise;<br />
In silence, ere that storm begin,<br />
Count o&rsquo;er His mercies and thy sin.</p>
<p class="poetry">Pray only that thine aching heart,<br />
From visions vain content to part,<br />
Strong for Love&rsquo;s sake its woe to hide<br />
May cheerful wait the Cross beside,<br />
Too happy if, that dreadful day,<br />
Thy life be given thee for a prey.</p>
<p class="poetry">Snatched sudden from th&rsquo; avenging rod,<br
/>
Safe in the bosom of thy <span class="smcap">God</span>,<br />
How wilt thou then look back, and smile<br />
On thoughts that bitterest seemed erewhile,<br />
And bless the pangs that made thee see<br />
This was no world of rest for thee!</p>
<h3>Twelfth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And looking up to heaven, He sighed, and saith
unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.&nbsp; <i>St. Mark</i>
vii. 34.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> Son of God in
doing good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was fain to look to Heaven and sigh:<br />
And shall the heirs of sinful blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek joy unmixed in charity?<br />
God will not let Love&rsquo;s work impart<br />
Full solace, lest it steal the heart;<br />
Be thou content in tears to sow,<br />
Blessing, like Jesus, in thy woe:</p>
<p class="poetry">He looked to Heaven, and sadly sighed&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; What saw my gracious Saviour there,<br />
&ldquo;With fear and anguish to divide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The joy of Heaven-accepted prayer?<br />
So o&rsquo;er the bed where Lazarus slept<br />
He to His Father groaned and wept:<br />
What saw He mournful in that grave,<br />
Knowing Himself so strong to save?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">O&rsquo;erwhelming thoughts of pain and
grief<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over His sinking spirit sweep;&mdash;<br />
What boots it gathering one lost leaf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of yon sere and withered heap,<br />
Where souls and bodies, hopes and joys,<br />
All that earth owns or sin destroys,<br />
Under the spurning hoof are cast,<br />
Or tossing in th&rsquo; autumnal blast?</p>
<p class="poetry">The deaf may hear the Saviour&rsquo;s voice,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fettered tongue its chain may break;<br />
But the deaf heart, the dumb by choice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The laggard soul, that will not wake,<br />
The guilt that scorns to be forgiven;&mdash;<br />
These baffle e&rsquo;en the spells of Heaven;<br />
In thought of these, His brows benign<br />
Not e&rsquo;en in healing cloudless shine.</p>
<p class="poetry">No eye but His might ever bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To gaze all down that drear abyss,<br />
Because none ever saw so clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The shore beyond of endless bliss:<br />
The giddy waves so restless hurled,<br />
The vexed pulse of this feverish world,<br />
He views and counts with steady sight,<br />
Used to behold the Infinite.</p>
<p class="poetry">But that in such communion high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath a fount of strength within,<br />
Sure His meek heart would break and die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;erburthened by His brethren&rsquo;s sin;<br
/>
Weak eyes on darkness dare not gaze,<br />
It dazzles like the noonday blaze;<br />
But He who sees God&rsquo;s face may brook<br />
On the true face of Sin to look.</p>
<p class="poetry">What then shall wretched sinners do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When in their last, their hopeless day,<br />
Sin, as it is, shall meet their view,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God turn His face for aye away?<br />
Lord, by Thy sad and earnest eye,<br />
When Thou didst look to Heaven and sigh:<br />
Thy voice, that with a word could chase<br />
The dumb, deaf spirit from his place;</p>
<p class="poetry">As Thou hast touched our ears, and taught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our tongues to speak Thy praises plain,<br />
Quell Thou each thankless godless thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That would make fast our bonds again.<br />
From worldly strife, from mirth unblest,<br />
Drowning Thy music in the breast,<br />
From foul reproach, from thrilling fears,<br />
Preserve, good Lord, Thy servants&rsquo; ears.</p>
<p class="poetry">From idle words, that restless throng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And haunt our hearts when we would pray,<br />
From Pride&rsquo;s false chime, and jarring wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seal Thou my lips, and guard the way:<br />
For Thou hast sworn, that every ear,<br />
Willing or loth, Thy trump shall hear,<br />
And every tongue unchain&egrave;d be<br />
To own no hope, no God, but Thee.</p>
<h3>Thirteenth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And He turned Him onto His disciples, and said
privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:
for I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see
those things which ye see, and have not seen them: and to hear
those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.&nbsp; <i>St.
Luke</i> x. 23, 24.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">On</span> Sinai&rsquo;s
top, in prayer and trance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full forty nights and forty days<br />
The Prophet watched for one dear glance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thee and of Thy ways:</p>
<p class="poetry">Fasting he watched and all alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrapt in a still, dark, solid cloud,<br />
The curtain of the Holy One<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawn round him like a shroud:</p>
<p class="poetry">So, separate from the world, his breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Might duly take and strongly keep<br />
The print of Heaven, to be expressed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere long on Sion&rsquo;s steep.</p>
<p class="poetry">There one by one his spirit saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of things divine the shadows bright,<br />
The pageant of God&rsquo;s perfect law;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet felt not full delight.</p>
<p class="poetry">Through gold and gems, a dazzling maze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From veil to veil the vision led,<br />
And ended, where unearthly rays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From o&rsquo;er the ark were shed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet not that gorgeous place, nor aught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of human or angelic frame,<br />
Could half appease his craving thought;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The void was still the same.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Show me Thy glory, gracious Lord!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Thee,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;not Thine,
I seek.&rdquo;<br />
Na, start not at so bold a word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From man, frail worm and weak:</p>
<p class="poetry">The spark of his first deathless fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet buoys him up, and high above<br />
The holiest creature, dares aspire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Creator&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p class="poetry">The eye in smiles may wander round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Caught by earth&rsquo;s shadows as they fleet;<br />
But for the soul no help is found,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save Him who made it, meet.</p>
<p class="poetry">Spite of yourselves, ye witness this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who blindly self or sense adore;<br />
Else wherefore leaving your own bliss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still restless ask ye more?</p>
<p class="poetry">This witness bore the saints of old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When highest rapt and favoured most,<br />
Still seeking precious things untold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not in fruition lost.</p>
<p class="poetry">Canaan was theirs; and in it all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The proudest hope of kings dare claim:<br />
Sion was theirs; and at their call<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire from Jehovah came.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet monarchs walked as pilgrims still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In their own land, earth&rsquo;s pride and grace:<br
/>
And seers would mourn on Sion&rsquo;s hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their Lord&rsquo;s averted face.</p>
<p class="poetry">Vainly they tried the deeps to sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en of their own prophetic thought,<br />
When of Christ crucified and crowned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His Spirit in them taught:</p>
<p class="poetry">But He their aching gaze repressed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which sought behind the veil to see,<br />
For not without us fully blest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or perfect might they be.</p>
<p class="poetry">The rays of the Almighty&rsquo;s face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No sinner&rsquo;s eye might then receive;<br />
Only the meekest man found grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see His skirts and live.</p>
<p class="poetry">But we as in a glass espy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The glory of His countenance,<br />
Not in a whirlwind hurrying by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The too presumptuous glance,</p>
<p class="poetry">But with mild radiance every hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From our dear Saviour&rsquo;s face benign<br />
Bent on us with transforming power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till we, too, faintly shine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sprinkled with His atoning blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Safely before our God we stand,<br />
As on the rock the Prophet stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath His shadowing hand.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Blessed eyes, which see the things we see!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet this tree of life hath proved<br />
To many a soul a poison tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beheld, and not beloved.</p>
<p class="poetry">So like an angel&rsquo;s is our bliss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Oh! thought to comfort and appal)<br />
It needs must bring, if used amiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An angel&rsquo;s hopeless fall.</p>
<h3>Fourteenth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten
cleansed? but where are the nine?&nbsp; There are not found that
returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.&nbsp; <i>St.
Luke</i> xvii. 17, 18.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ten</span> cleansed, and
only one remain!<br />
Who would have thought our nature&rsquo;s stain<br />
Was dyed so foul, so deep in grain?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en He who reads the heart&mdash;<br />
Knows what He gave and what we lost,<br />
Sin&rsquo;s forfeit, and redemption&rsquo;s cost,&mdash;<br />
By a short pang of wonder crossed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems at the sight to start:</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet &rsquo;twas not wonder, but His love<br />
Our wavering spirits would reprove,<br />
That heavenward seem so free to move<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When earth can yield no more<br />
Then from afar on God we cry,<br />
But should the mist of woe roll by,<br />
Not showers across an April sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drift, when the storm is o&rsquo;er,</p>
<p class="poetry">Faster than those false drops and few<br />
Fleet from the heart, a worthless dew.<br />
What sadder scene can angels view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than self-deceiving tears,<br />
Poured idly over some dark page<br />
Of earlier life, though pride or rage,<br />
The record of to-day engage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A woe for future years?</p>
<p class="poetry">Spirits, that round the sick man&rsquo;s bed<br
/>
Watched, noting down each prayer he made,<br />
Were your unerring roll displayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His pride of health to abase;<br />
Or, when, soft showers in season fall<br />
Answering a famished nation&rsquo;s call,<br />
Should unseen fingers on the wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our vows forgotten trace:</p>
<p class="poetry">How should we gaze in trance of fear!<br />
Yet shines the light as thrilling clear<br />
From Heaven upon that scroll severe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ten cleansed and one remain!&rdquo;<br />
Nor surer would the blessing prove<br />
Of humbled hearts, that own Thy love,<br />
Should choral welcome from above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Visit our senses plain:</p>
<p class="poetry">Than by Thy placid voice and brow,<br />
With healing first, with comfort now,<br />
Turned upon him, who hastes to bow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Thee, heart and knee;<br />
&ldquo;Oh! thou, who only wouldst be blest,<br />
On thee alone My blessing rest!<br />
Rise, go thy way in peace, possessed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For evermore of Me.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Fifteenth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Consider the lilies of the field, how they
grow.&nbsp; <i>St. Matthew</i>, vi. 28.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Sweet</span> nurslings of
the vernal skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bathed in soft airs, and fed with dew,<br />
What more than magic in you lies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To fill the heart&rsquo;s fond view?<br />
In childhood&rsquo;s sports, companions gay,<br />
In sorrow, on Life&rsquo;s downward way,<br />
How soothing! in our last decay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Memorials prompt and true.</p>
<p class="poetry">Relics ye are of Eden&rsquo;s bowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As pure, as fragrant, and as fair,<br />
As when ye crowned the sunshine hours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of happy wanderers there.<br />
Fall&rsquo;n all beside&mdash;the world of life,<br />
How is it stained with fear and strife!<br />
In Reason&rsquo;s world what storms are rife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What passions range and glare!</p>
<p class="poetry">But cheerful and unchanged the while<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your first and perfect form ye show,<br />
The same that won Eve&rsquo;s matron smile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the world&rsquo;s opening glow.<br />
The stars of heaven a course are taught<br />
Too high above our human thought:<br />
Ye may be found if ye are sought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And as we gaze, we know.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye dwell beside our paths and homes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our paths of sin, our homes of sorrow,<br />
And guilty man where&rsquo;er he roams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your innocent mirth may borrow.<br />
The birds of air before us fleet,<br />
They cannot brook our shame to meet&mdash;<br />
But we may taste your solace sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And come again to-morrow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye fearless in your nests abide&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor may we scorn, too proudly wise,<br />
Your silent lessons, undescried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By all but lowly eyes:<br />
For ye could draw th&rsquo; admiring gaze<br />
Of Him who worlds and hearts surveys:<br />
Your order wild, your fragrant maze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He taught us how to prize.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye felt your Maker&rsquo;s smile that hour,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As when He paused and owned you good;<br />
His blessing on earth&rsquo;s primal bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye felt it all renewed.<br />
What care ye now, if winter&rsquo;s storm<br />
Sweep ruthless o&rsquo;er each silken form?<br />
Christ&rsquo;s blessing at your heart is warm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye fear no vexing mood.</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas! of thousand bosoms kind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That daily court you and caress,<br />
How few the happy secret find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of your calm loveliness!<br />
&ldquo;Live for to-day! to-morrow&rsquo;s light<br />
To-morrow&rsquo;s cares shall bring to sight,<br />
Go sleep like closing flowers at night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Heaven thy morn will bless.&rdquo;</p>

Look to the Cross and thou shalt see<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Or ease? the Cross is bitter grief:<br />
More pangs than tongue or heart can frame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were suffered there without relief.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet guide us in Thy track of love:<br />
Let us gaze on where light should be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though not a beam the clouds remove.</p>
<p class="poetry">So wanderers ever fond and true<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look homeward through the evening sky,<br />
Without a streak of heaven&rsquo;s soft blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To aid Affection&rsquo;s dreaming eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">The wanderer seeks his native bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we will look and long for Thee,<br />
And thank Thee for each trying hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wishing, not struggling, to be free.</p>

his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his
iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the Lord

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Stately</span> thy walls,

Not statelier, towering o&rsquo;er her marble stairs,<br />

Not holier, while around him angels bowed,<br />
From Aaron&rsquo;s censer steamed the spicy cloud,</p>
<p class="poetry">Before the mercy-seat.&nbsp; O Mother dear,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilt thou forgive thy son one boding sigh?<br />
Forgive, if round thy towers he walk in fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tell thy jewels o&rsquo;er with jealous eye?<br

Mindful of that sad vision, which in thought<br />
From Chebar&rsquo;s plains the captive prophet brought.</p>
<p class="poetry">To see lost Sion&rsquo;s shame.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas morning prime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And like a Queen new seated on her throne,<br />
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> crown&egrave;d mountain,
as in happier time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seemed to rejoice in sunshine all her own:<br />
So bright, while all in shade around her lay,<br />
Her northern pinnacles had caught th&rsquo; emerging ray.</p>
<p class="poetry">The dazzling lines of her majestic roof<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crossed with as free a span the vault of heaven,<br

As when twelve tribes knelt silently aloof<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere <span class="smcap">God</span> His answer to
their king had given,<br />
Ere yet upon the new-built altar fell<br />
The glory of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the Lord of
Israel.</p>

And watch their shameless and unholy glee,<br />

Hear Judah&rsquo;s maids the dirge to Thammuz pour,<br />
And mark her chiefs yon orient sun adore.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet turn thee, son of man&mdash;for worse than

&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, learn to tell aright thine own sins&rsquo;
cost,&mdash;<br />
And sure their sin as far from equals thine,<br />
As earthly hopes abused are less than hopes divine.</p>
<p class="poetry">What if within His world, His Church, our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have entered thee, as in some temple gate,<br />
Where, looking round, each glance might thee afford<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some glorious earnest of thine high estate,<br />
And thou, false heart and frail, hast turned from all<br />
To worship pleasure&rsquo;s shadow on the wall?</p>
<p class="poetry">If, when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of
Glory was in sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou turn thy back upon that fountain clear,<br />
To bow before the &ldquo;little drop of light,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which dim-eyed men call praise and glory here;<br />
What dost thou, but adore the sun, and scorn<br />
Him at whose only word both sun and stars were born?</p>
<p class="poetry">If, while around thee gales from Eden
breathe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hide thine eyes, to make thy peevish moan<br />
Over some broken reed of earth beneath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some darling of blind fancy dead and gone,<br />
As wisely might&rsquo;st thou in <span
class="smcap">Jehovah&rsquo;s</span> fane<br />
Offer thy love and tears to Thammuz slain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Turn thee from these, or dare not to inquire<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Him whose name is Jealous, lest in wrath<br />
He hear and answer thine unblest desire:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far better we should cross His lightning&rsquo;s
path<br />
Than be according to our idols beard,<br />
And God should take us at our own vain word.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou who hast deigned the Christian&rsquo;s
heart to call<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy Church and Shrine; whene&rsquo;er our rebel
will<br />
Would in that chosen home of Thine instal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Belial or Mammon, grant us not the ill<br />
We blindly ask; in very love refuse<br />
Whate&rsquo;er Thou knowest our weakness would abuse.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or rather help us, <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, to choose the good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To pray for nought, to seek to none, but Thee,<br />
Nor by &ldquo;our daily bread&rdquo; mean common food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor say, &ldquo;From this world&rsquo;s evil set us
free;&rdquo;<br />
Teach us to love, with <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, our
sole true bliss,<br />
Else, though in <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> own
words, we surely pray amiss.</p>
<h3>Eighteenth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>I will bring you into the wilderness of the
people, and there will I plead with you face to face.&nbsp; Like
as pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of
Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord God.&nbsp;
<i>Ezekiel</i> xx. 35, 36.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">It</span> is so&mdash;ope
thine eyes, and see&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What viewest thou all around?<br />
A desert, where iniquity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And knowledge both abound.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the waste howling wilderness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Church is wandering still,<br />
Because we would not onward press<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When close to Sion&rsquo;s hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">Back to the world we faithless turned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And far along the wild,<br />
With labour lost and sorrow earned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our steps have been beguiled.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet full before us, all the while,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The shadowing pillar stays,<br />
The living waters brightly smile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The eternal turrets blaze,</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet Heaven is raining angels&rsquo; bread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be our daily food,<br />
And fresh, as when it first was shed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Springs forth the <span
class="smcap">Saviour&rsquo;s</span> blood.</p>
<p class="poetry">From every region, race, and speech,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Believing myriads throng,<br />
Till, far as sin and sorrow reach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy grace is spread along;</p>
<p class="poetry">Till sweetest nature, brightest art,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their votive incense bring,<br />
And every voice and every heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Own Thee their God and King.</p>
<p class="poetry">All own; but few, alas! will love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too like the recreant band<br />
That with Thy patient spirit strove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the Red-sea strand.</p>
<p class="poetry">O Father of long-suffering grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou who hast sworn to stay<br />
Pleading with sinners face to face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through all their devious way:</p>
<p class="poetry">How shall we speak to Thee, O <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or how in silence lie?<br />
Look on us, and we are abhorred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn from us, and we die.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy guardian fire, Thy guiding cloud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still let them gild our wall,<br />
Nor be our foes and Thine allowed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see us faint and fall.</p>
<p class="poetry">Too oft, within this camp of Thine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebellions murmurs rise;<br />
Sin cannot bear to see Thee shine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So awful to her eyes.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fain would our lawless hearts escape,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the heathen be,<br />
To worship every monstrous shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In fancied darkness free.</p>
<p class="poetry">Vain thought, that shall not be at all!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Refuse we or obey,<br />
Our ears have heard the Almighty&rsquo;s call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot be as they.</p>
<p class="poetry">We cannot hope the heathen&rsquo;s doom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To whom <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Son
is given,<br />
Whose eyes have seen beyond the tomb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who have the key of Heaven.</p>
<p class="poetry">Weak tremblers on the edge of woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet shrinking from true bliss,<br />
Our rest must be &ldquo;no rest below,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And let our prayer be this:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, wave
again Thy chastening rod,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till every idol throne<br />
Crumble to dust, and Thou, O <span class="smcap">God</span>,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reign in our hearts alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Bring all our wandering fancies home,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Thou hast every spell,<br />
And &rsquo;mid the heathen where they roam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou knowest, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, too
well.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Thou know&rsquo;st our service sad and
hard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou know&rsquo;st us fond and frail;<br />
Win us to be loved and spared<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all the world shall fail.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;So when at last our weary days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are well-nigh wasted here,<br />
And we can trace Thy wondrous ways<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In distance calm and clear,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;When in Thy love and Israel&rsquo;s
sin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We read our story true,<br />
We may not, all too late, begin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To wish our hopes were new.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Long loved, long tried, long spared as
they,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike in this alone,<br />
That, by Thy grace, our hearts shall stay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For evermore Thine own.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Nineteenth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and
rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did
not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?&nbsp;
They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.&nbsp; He
answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst
of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is
like the Son of God.&nbsp; <i>Daniel</i> iii. 24, 25.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span>
Persecution&rsquo;s torrent blaze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wraps the unshrinking Martyr&rsquo;s head;<br />
When fade all earthly flowers and bays,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When summer friends are gone and fled,<br />
Is he alone in that dark hour<br />
Who owns the Lord of love and power?</p>
<p class="poetry">Or waves there not around his brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A wand no human arm may wield,<br />
Fraught with a spell no angels know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His steps to guide, his soul to shield?<br />
Thou, Saviour, art his Charm&egrave;d Bower,<br />
His Magic Ring, his Rock, his Tower.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when the wicked ones behold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy favourites walking in Thy light,<br />
Just as, in fancy triumph bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They deemed them lost in deadly night,<br />
Amazed they cry, &ldquo;What spell is this,<br />
Which turns their sufferings all to bliss?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;How are they free whom we had bound?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upright, whom in the gulf we cast?<br />
What wondrous helper have they found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To screen them from the scorching blast?<br />
Three were they&mdash;who hath made them four?<br />
And sure a form divine he wore,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;E&rsquo;en like the Son of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; So cried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tyrant, when in one fierce flame<br />
The Martyrs lived, the murderers died:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet knew he not what angel came<br />
To make the rushing fire-flood seem<br />
Like summer breeze by woodland stream.</p>
<p class="poetry">He knew not, but there are who know:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Matron, who alone hath stood,<br />
When not a prop seemed left below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The first lorn hour of widowhood,<br />
Yet cheered and cheering all, the while,<br />
With sad but unaffected smile;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Father, who his vigil keeps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the sad couch whence hope hath flown,<br />
Watching the eye where reason sleeps,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet in his heart can mercy own,<br />
Still sweetly yielding to the rod,<br />
Still loving man, still thanking <span
class="smcap">God</span>;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Christian Pastor, bowed to earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With thankless toil, and vile esteemed,<br />
Still travailing in second birth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of souls that will not be redeemed:<br />
Yet stedfast set to do his part,<br />
And fearing most his own vain heart;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">These know: on these look long and well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleansing thy sight by prayer and faith,<br />
And thou shalt know what secret spell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Preserves them in their living death:<br />
Through sevenfold flames thine eye shall see<br />
The Saviour walking with His faithful Three.</p>
<h3>Twentieth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord&rsquo;s
controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth.&nbsp;
<i>Micah</i> vi. 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Where</span> is Thy
favoured haunt, eternal Voice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The region of Thy choice,<br />
Where, undisturbed by sin and earth, the soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Owns Thy entire control?&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis on the mountain&rsquo;s summit dark and high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When storms are hurrying by:<br />
&rsquo;Tis &rsquo;mid the strong foundations of the earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where torrents have their birth.</p>
<p class="poetry">No sounds of worldly toil ascending there,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mar the full burst of prayer;<br />
Lone Nature feels that she may freely breathe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And round us and beneath<br />
Are heard her sacred tones: the fitful sweep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of winds across the steep<br />
Through withered bents&mdash;romantic note and clear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet for a hermit&rsquo;s ear,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">The wheeling kite&rsquo;s wild solitary cry,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, scarcely heard so high,<br />
The dashing waters when the air is still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From many a torrent rill<br />
That winds unseen beneath the shaggy fell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracked by the blue mist well:<br />
Such sounds as make deep silence in the heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Thought to do her part.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis then we hear the voice of <span
class="smcap">God</span> within,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pleading with care and sin:<br />
&ldquo;Child of My love! how have I wearied thee?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why wilt thou err from Me?<br />
Have I not brought thee from the house of slaves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Parted the drowning waves,<br />
And set My saints before thee in the way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest thou shouldst faint or stray?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What! was the promise made to thee
alone?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Art thou the excepted one?<br />
An heir of glory without grief or pain?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O vision false and vain!<br />
There lies thy cross; beneath it meekly bow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It fits thy stature now:<br />
Who scornful pass it with averted eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill crush them by-and-by.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Raise thy repining eyes, and take true
measure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thine eternal treasure;<br />
The Father of thy Lord can grudge thee nought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world for thee was bought;<br />
And as this landscape broad&mdash;earth, sea, and sky,&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; All centres in thine eye,<br />
So all God does, if rightly understood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall work thy final good.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Twenty-first Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>The vision is yet for an appointed time, but at
the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">The</span> morning mist is cleared away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet still the face of Heaven is grey,<br />
Nor yet this autumnal breeze has stirred the grove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faded yet full, a paler green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Skirts soberly the tranquil scene,<br />
The red-breast warbles round this leafy cove.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet messenger of
&ldquo;calm decay,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Saluting sorrow as you may,<br />
As one still bent to find or make the best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In thee, and in this quiet mead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lesson of sweet peace I read,<br />
Rather in all to be resigned than blest.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis a low chant,
according well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the soft solitary knell,<br />
As homeward from some grave beloved we turn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or by some holy death-bed dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most welcome to the chastened ear<br />
Of her whom Heaven is teaching how to mourn.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O cheerful tender strain! the
heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That duly bears with you its part,<br />
Singing so thankful to the dreary blast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though gone and spent its joyous prime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the world&rsquo;s autumnal time,<br />
&rsquo;Mid withered hues and sere, its lot be cast:</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the heart for
thoughtful seer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Watching, in trance nor dark nor clear,<br />
Th&rsquo; appalling Future as it nearer draws:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His spirit calmed the storm to meet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling the rock beneath his feet,<br />
And tracing through the cloud th&rsquo; eternal Cause.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the heart for
watchman true<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting to see what <span class="smcap">God</span>
will do,<br />
As o&rsquo;er the Church the gathering twilight falls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more he strains his wistful eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If chance the golden hours be nigh,<br />
By youthful Hope seen beaming round her walls.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forced from his shadowy
paradise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His thoughts to Heaven the steadier rise:<br />
There seek his answer when the world reproves:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Contented in his darkling round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If only he be faithful found,<br />
When from the east the eternal morning moves.</p>

<p class="poetry">Unheard in summer&rsquo;s flaring ray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour forth thy notes, sweet singer,<br />
Wooing the stillness of the autumn day:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid it a moment linger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor fly<br />
Too soon from winter&rsquo;s scowling eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">The blackbird&rsquo;s song at even-tide,<br />

Filling the heavens far and wide,<br />

With calm decay, and peace divine.</p>

Reckless of regions far away,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The cries of camp or town,<br />
Never untuned his lonely mirth,<br />

<p class="poetry">Two ways alone his roving eye<br />

Or in the azure deep on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or darksome mere below.</p>
<p class="poetry">O blest restraint! more bless&egrave;d

&nbsp;&nbsp; Too soon the happy child<br />
His nook of homely thought will change<br />

With sun-bright pleasures to and fro<br />

Less keenly, thorough his grosser ear,<br />

While from His pard&rsquo;ning Cross He calls,<br />

<p class="poetry">By our own niggard rule we try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hope to suppliants given!<br />
We mete out love, as if our eye<br />

How dearly to embrace thy foe,<br />

Whatever owns, in depth or height,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation&rsquo;s wondrous bond;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then in their solemn pageant learn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet mercy&rsquo;s praise to see:<br />

<blockquote><p>Who shall change our vile body, that it may be
fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the working
whereby He is able even to subdue all things onto Himself.&nbsp;
<i>Philippians</i> iii. 21.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Red</span> o&rsquo;er the
forest peers the setting sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The line of yellow light dies fast away<br />
That crowned the eastern copse: and chill and dun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Falls on the moor the brief November day.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now the tired hunter winds a parting note,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Echo hide good-night from every glade;<br />
Yet wait awhile, and see the calm heaves float<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each to his rest beneath their parent shade.</p>
<p class="poetry">How like decaying life they seem to glide!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet no second spring have they in store,<br />
But where they fall, forgotten to abide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is all their portion, and they ask no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">Soon o&rsquo;er their heads blithe April airs
shall sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A thousand wild-flowers round them shall unfold,<br
/>
The green buds glisten in the dews of Spring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all be vernal rapture as of old.</p>
<p class="poetry">Unconscious they in waste oblivion lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the world of busy life around<br />
No thought of them; in all the bounteous sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No drop, for them, of kindly influence found.</p>
<p class="poetry">Man&rsquo;s portion is to die and rise
again&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet he complains, while these unmurmuring part<br />
With their sweet lives, as pure from sin and stain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As his when Eden held his virgin heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">And haply half unblamed his murmuring voice<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Might sound in Heaven, were all his second life<br
/>
Only the first renewed&mdash;the heathen&rsquo;s choice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A round of listless joy and weary strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">For dreary were this earth, if earth were
all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tho&rsquo; brightened oft by dear Affection&rsquo;s
kiss;&mdash;<br />
Who for the spangles wears the funeral pall?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But catch a gleam beyond it, and &rsquo;tis
bliss.</p>
<p class="poetry">Heavy and dull this frame of limbs and
heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether slow creeping on cold earth, or borne<br />
On lofty steed, or loftier prow, we dart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er wave or field: yet breezes laugh to
scorn</p>
<p class="poetry">Our puny speed, and birds, and clouds in
heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fish, living shafts that pierce the main,<br />
And stars that shoot through freezing air at even&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who but would follow, might he break his chain?</p>
<p class="poetry">And thou shalt break it soon; the grovelling
worm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall find his wings, and soar as fast and free<br
/>
As his transfigured Lord with lightning form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And snowy vest&mdash;such grace He won for thee,</p>
<p class="poetry">When from the grave He sprang at dawn of
morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And led through boundless air thy conquering
road,<br />
Leaving a glorious track, where saints, new-born,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Might fearless follow to their blest abode.</p>
<p class="poetry">But first, by many a stern and fiery blast<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world&rsquo;s rude furnace must thy blood
refine,<br />
And many a gale of keenest woe be passed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till every pulse beat true to airs divine,</p>
<p class="poetry">Till every limb obey the mounting soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mounting soul, the call by Jesus given.<br />
He who the stormy heart can so control,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The laggard body soon will waft to Heaven.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Why</span> should we faint
and fear to live alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since all alone, so Heaven has willed, we die,<br />
Nor e&rsquo;en the tenderest heart, and next our own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Knows half the reasons why we smile and sigh?</p>
<p class="poetry">Each in his hidden sphere of joy or woe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our hermit spirits dwell, and range apart,<br />
Our eyes see all around in gloom or glow&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hues of their own, fresh borrowed from the
heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">And well it is for us our <span
class="smcap">God</span> should feel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone our secret throbbings: so our prayer<br />
May readier spring to Heaven, nor spend its zeal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On cloud-born idols of this lower air.</p>
<p class="poetry">For if one heart in perfect sympathy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beat with another, answering love for love,<br />
Weak mortals, all entranced, on earth would lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor listen for those purer strains above.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or what if Heaven for once its searching
light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lent to some partial eye, disclosing all<br />
The rude bad thoughts, that in our bosom&rsquo;s night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wander at large, nor heed Love&rsquo;s gentle
thrall?</p>
<p class="poetry">Who would not shun the dreary uncouth place?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if, fond leaning where her infant slept,<br />
A mother&rsquo;s arm a serpent should embrace:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So might we friendless live, and die unwept.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then keep the softening veil in mercy drawn,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou who canst love us, thro&rsquo; Thou read us
true;<br />
As on the bosom of th&rsquo; a&euml;rial lawn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Melts in dim haze each coarse ungentle hue.</p>
<p class="poetry">So too may soothing Hope Thy heave enjoy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet visions of long-severed hearts to frame:<br />
Though absence may impair, or cares annoy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some constant mind may draw us still the same.</p>
<p class="poetry">We in dark dreams are tossing to and fro,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pine with regret, or sicken with despair,<br />
The while she bathes us in her own chaste glow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with our memory wings her own fond prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">O bliss of child-like innocence, and love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried to old age! creative power to win,<br />
And raise new worlds, where happy fancies rove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgetting quite this grosser world of sin.</p>
<p class="poetry">Bright are their dreams, because their thoughts
are clear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their memory cheering: but th&rsquo; earth-stained
spright,<br />
Whose wakeful musings are of guilt and fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must hover nearer earth, and less in light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Farewell, for her, th&rsquo; ideal scenes so
fair&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet not farewell her hope, since thou hast
deigned,<br />
Creator of all hearts! to own and share<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The woe of what Thou mad&rsquo;st, and we have
stained.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou knowst our bitterness&mdash;our joys are
Thine&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No stranger Thou to all our wanderings wild:<br />
Nor could we bear to think, how every line<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of us, Thy darkened likeness and defiled,</p>
<p class="poetry">Stands in full sunshine of Thy piercing eye,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But that Thou call&rsquo;st us Brethren: sweet
repose<br />
Is in that word&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> who
dwells on high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Knows all, yet loves us better than He knows.</p>
<h3>Twenty-fifth Sunday after Trinity.</h3>
<blockquote><p>The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found
in the way of righteousness.&nbsp; <i>Proverbs</i> xvi. 31.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> bright-haired
morn is glowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er emerald meadows gay,<br />
With many a clear gem strewing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The early shepherd&rsquo;s way.<br />
Ye gentle elves, by Fancy seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stealing away with night<br />
To slumber in your leafy screen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tread more than airy light.</p>
<p class="poetry">And see what joyous greeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun through heaven has shed,<br />
Though fast yon shower be fleeting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His beams have faster sped.<br />
For lo! above the western haze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High towers the rainbow arch<br />
In solid span of purest rays:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How stately is its march!</p>
<p class="poetry">Pride of the dewy morning!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The swain&rsquo;s experienced eye<br />
From thee takes timely warning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor trusts the gorgeous sky.<br />
For well he knows, such dawnings gay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring noons of storm and shower,<br />
And travellers linger on the way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the sheltering bower.</p>
<p class="poetry">E&rsquo;en so, in hope and trembling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should watchful shepherd view<br />
His little lambs assembling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With glance both kind and true;<br />
&rsquo;Tis not the eye of keenest blaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor the quick-swelling breast,<br />
That soonest thrills at touch of praise&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These do not please him best.</p>
<p class="poetry">But voices low and gentle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And timid glances shy,<br />
That seem for aid parental<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sue all wistfully,<br />
Still pressing, longing to be right,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet fearing to be wrong,&mdash;<br />
In these the Pastor dares delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A lamb-like, Christ-like throng.</p>
<p class="poetry">These in Life&rsquo;s distant even<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall shine serenely bright,<br />
As in th&rsquo; autumnal heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mild rainbow tints at night,<br />
When the last shower is stealing down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ere they sink to rest,<br />
The sun-beams weave a parting crown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For some sweet woodland nest.</p>
<p class="poetry">The promise of the morrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is glorious on that eve,<br />
Dear as the holy sorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When good men cease to live.<br />
When brightening ere it die away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mounts up their altar flame,<br />
Still tending with intenser ray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Heaven whence first it came.</p>
<p class="poetry">Say not it dies, that glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis caught unquenched on high,<br />
Those saintlike brows so hoary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall wear it in the sky.<br />
No smile is like the smile of death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all good musings past<br />
Rise wafted with the parting breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweetest thought the last.</p>
<h3>Sunday next before Advent.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing
be lost.&nbsp; <i>St. John</i> vi. 12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Will</span> God indeed with fragments bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Snatched late from the decaying year?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or can the Saviour&rsquo;s blood endear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dregs of a polluted life?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When down th&rsquo; o&rsquo;erwhelming current
tossed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just ere he sink for ever lost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sailor&rsquo;s untried arms are crossed<br />
In agonizing prayer, will Ocean cease her strife?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighs that exhaust but not
relieve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart-rending sighs, O spare to heave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A bosom freshly taught to grieve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For lavished hours and love
misspent!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now through her round of holy thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Church our annual steps has brought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But we no holy fire have caught&mdash;<br />
Back on the gaudy world our wilful eyes were bent.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too soon th&rsquo; ennobling
carols, poured<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To hymn the birth-night of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which duteous Memory should have stored<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For thankful echoing all the
year&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too soon those airs have passed away;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor long within the heart would stay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The silence of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> dying day,<br />
Profaned by worldly mirth, or scared by worldly fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some strain of hope and
victory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Easter wings might lift us high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A little while we sought the sky:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when the <span
class="smcap">Spirit&rsquo;s</span> beacon fires<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On every hill began to blare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightening the world with glad amaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who but must kindle while they gaze?<br />
But faster than she soars, our earth-bound Fancy tires.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet for these, nor all
the rites,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By which our Mother&rsquo;s voice invites<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our <span class="smcap">God</span> to bless our home
delights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sweeten every secret
tear:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The funeral dirge, the marriage vow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hollowed font where parents bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now elate and trembling now<br />
To the Redeemer&rsquo;s feet their new-found treasures
bear:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for this Pastor&rsquo;s
gracious arm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stretched out to bless&mdash;a Christian charm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To dull the shafts of worldly harm:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor, sweetest, holiest, best of
all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the dear feast of <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> dying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon that altar ever lying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where souls with sacred hunger sighing<br />
Are called to sit and eat, while angels prostrate
fall:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not for each and all of
these,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have our frail spirits found their ease.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gale that stirs the autumnal trees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems tuned as truly to our
hearts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As when, twelve weary months ago,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas moaning bleak, so high and low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You would have thought Remorse and Woe<br />
Had taught the innocent air their sadly thrilling parts.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it, <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> light is too divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We dare not hope like Him to shine?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But see, around His dazzling shrine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earths gems the fire of Heaven
have caught;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Martyrs and saints&mdash;each glorious day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dawning in order on our way&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Remind us, how our darksome clay<br />
May keep th&rsquo; ethereal warmth our new Creator brought.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These we have scorned, O
false and frail!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now once more th&rsquo; appalling tale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How love divine may woo and fail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our lost year in Heaven is
told&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What if as far our life were past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our weeks all numbered to the last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With time and hope behind us cast,<br />
And all our work to do with palsied hands and cold?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O watch and pray ere Advent
dawn!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For thinner than the subtlest lawn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twixt thee and death the veil is drawn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Love too late can never
glow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The scattered fragments Love can glean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Refine the dregs, and yield us clean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To regions where one thought serene<br />
Breathes sweeter than whole years of sacrifice below.</p>
<h3>St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day</h3>
<blockquote><p>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith
unto him, We have found the Messias . . . And he brought him to
Jesus.&nbsp; <i>St. John</i> i. 41, 42.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> brothers part
for manhood&rsquo;s race,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What gift may most endearing prove<br />
To keep fond memory its her place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And certify a brother&rsquo;s love?</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis true, bright hours together told,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And blissful dreams in secret shared,<br />
Serene or solemn, gay or bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall last in fancy unimpaired.</p>
<p class="poetry">E&rsquo;en round the death-bed of the good<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such dear remembrances will hover,<br />
And haunt us with no vexing mood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all the cares of earth are over.</p>
<p class="poetry">But yet our craving spirits feel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall live on, though Fancy die,<br />
And seek a surer pledge&mdash;a seal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of love to last eternally.</p>
<p class="poetry">Who art thou, that wouldst grave thy name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus deeply in a brother&rsquo;s heart?<br />
Look on this saint, and learn to frame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy love-charm with true Christian art.</p>
<p class="poetry">First seek thy Saviour out, and dwell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath this shadow of His roof,<br />
Till thou have scanned His features well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And known Him for the Christ by proof;</p>
<p class="poetry">Such proof as they are sure to find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who spend with Him their happy days,<br />
Clean hands, and a self-ruling mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever in tune for love and praise.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, potent with the spell of Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go, and thine erring brother gain,<br />
Entice him home to be forgiven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till he, too, see his Saviour plain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or, if before thee in the race,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Urge him with thine advancing tread,<br />
Till, like twin stars, with even pace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each lucid course be duly aped.</p>
<p class="poetry">No fading frail memorial give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To soothe his soul when thou art gone,<br />
But wreaths of hope for aye to live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thoughts of good together done.</p>
<p class="poetry">That so, before the judgment-seat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though changed and glorified each face,<br />
Not unremembered ye may meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For endless ages to embrace.</p>
<h3>St. Thomas&rsquo; Day.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Thomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast
believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
believed.&nbsp; <i>St. John</i> xx. 29.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">We</span>
were not by when Jesus came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But round us, far and near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We see His trophies, and His name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In choral echoes hear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a fair ground our lot is cast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the solemn week that past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While some might doubt, but all adored,<br />
Ere the whole widowed Church had seen her risen Lord.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, as then, His
bounteous hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The golden chain unwinds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawing to Heaven with gentlest band<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wise hearts and loving minds.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love sought Him first&mdash;at dawn of morn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From her sad couch she sprang forlorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She sought to weep with Thee alone,<br />
And saw Thine open grave, and knew that thou wert gone.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reason and Faith at once set
out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To search the <span
class="smcap">Saviour&rsquo;s</span> tomb;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith faster runs, but waits without,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As fearing to presume,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till Reason enter in, and trace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s relics round the holy place&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here lay His limbs, and here His sacred
head,<br />
And who was by, to make His new-forsaken bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both wonder, one
believes&mdash;but while<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They muse on all at home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No thought can tender Love beguile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Jesus&rsquo; grave to
roam.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weeping she stays till He appear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her witness first the Church must hear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All joy to souls that can rejoice<br />
With her at earliest call of His dear gracious voice.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy too to those, who love to
talk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In secret how He died,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though with sealed eyes awhile they walk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor see him at their side:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most like the faithful pair are they,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who once to Emmaus took their way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Half darkling, till their Master shied<br />
His glory on their souls, made known in breaking bread.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, ever brighter and more
bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On those He came to save<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord of new-created light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dawned gradual from the grave;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till passed th&rsquo; enquiring day-light hour,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with closed door in silent bower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Church in anxious musing sate,<br />
As one who for redemption still had long to wait.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, gliding through
th&rsquo; unopening door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smooth without step or sound,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace to your souls,&rdquo; He said&mdash;no
more&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They own Him, kneeling round.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eye, ear, and hand, and loving heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Body and soul in every part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Successive made His witnesses that hour,<br />
Cease not in all the world to show His saving power.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there, on earth, a spirit
frail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who fears to take their word,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarce daring, through the twilight pale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To think he sees the Lord?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With eyes too tremblingly awake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bear with dimness for His sake?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Read and confess the Hand Divine<br />
That drew thy likeness here so true in every line.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all thy rankling doubts
so sore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love thou thy Saviour still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Him for thy Lord and God adore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ever do His will.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though vexing thoughts may seem to last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let not thy soul be quite o&rsquo;ercast;&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon will He show thee all His wounds, and say,<br
/>
&ldquo;Long have I known Thy name&mdash;know thou My face
alway.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Conversion of St. Paul.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying
unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?&nbsp; And he said,
Who art Thou, Lord?&nbsp; And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest.&nbsp; <i>Acts</i> ix. 4, 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> mid-day sun,
with fiercest glare,<br />
Broods o&rsquo;er the hazy twinkling air:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the level sand<br />
The palm-tree&rsquo;s shade unwavering lies,<br />
Just as thy towers, Damascus, rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To greet you wearied band.</p>
<p class="poetry">The leader of that martial crew<br />
Seems bent some mighty deed to do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So steadily he speeds,<br />
With lips firm closed and fix&egrave;d eye,<br />
Like warrior when the fight is night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor talk nor landscape heeds.</p>
<p class="poetry">What sudden blaze is round him poured,<br />
As though all Heaven&rsquo;s refulgent hoard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In one rich glory shone?<br />
One moment&mdash;and to earth he falls:<br />
What voice his inmost heart appalls?&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Voice heard by him alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">For to the rest both words and form<br />
Seem lost in lightning and in storm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Saul, in wakeful trance,<br />
Sees deep within that dazzling field<br />
His persecuted Lord revealed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With keen yet pitying glance:</p>
<p class="poetry">And hears time meek upbraiding call<br />
As gently on his spirit fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if th&rsquo; Almighty Son<br />
Were prisoner yet in this dark earth,<br />
Nor had proclaimed His royal birth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor His great power begun.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Ah! wherefore persecut&rsquo;st thou
Me?&rdquo;<br />
He heard and saw, and sought to free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His strained eyes from the sight:<br />
But Heaven&rsquo;s high magic bound it there,<br />
Still gazing, though untaught to bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Th&rsquo; insufferable light.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Who art Thou, Lord?&rdquo; he falters
forth:&mdash;<br />
So shall Sin ask of heaven and earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last awful day.<br />
&ldquo;When did we see Thee suffering nigh,<br />
And passed Thee with unheeding eye?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Great God of judgment, say!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah! little dream our listless eyes<br />
What glorious presence they despise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While, in our noon of life,<br />
To power or fame we rudely press.&mdash;<br />
Christ is at hand, to scorn or bless,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ suffers in our strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">And though heaven&rsquo;s gate long since have
closed,<br />
And our dear Lord in bliss reposed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High above mortal ken,<br />
To every ear in every land<br />
(Thought meek ears only understand)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He speaks as he did then.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Ah! wherefore persecute ye Me?<br />
&rsquo;Tis hard, ye so in love should be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With your own endless woe.<br />
Know, though at God&rsquo;s right hand I live,<br />
I feel each wound ye reckless give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the least saint below.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I in your care My brethren left,<br />
Not willing ye should be bereft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of waiting on your Lord.<br />
The meanest offering ye can make&mdash;<br />
A drop of water&mdash;for love&rsquo;s sake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Heaven, be sure, is stored.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">O by those gentle tones and dear,<br />
When thou hast stayed our wild career,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou only hope of souls,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er let us cast one look behind,<br />
But in the thought of Jesus find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What every thought controls.</p>
<p class="poetry">As to Thy last Apostle&rsquo;s heart<br />
Thy lightning glance did then impart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Zeal&rsquo;s never-dying fire,<br />
So teach us on Thy shrine to lay<br />
Our hearts, and let them day by day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Intenser blaze and higher.</p>
<p class="poetry">And as each mild and winning note<br />
(Like pulses that round harp-strings float<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the full strain is o&rsquo;er)<br />
Left lingering on his inward ear<br />
Music, that taught, as death drew near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love&rsquo;s lesson more and more:</p>
<p class="poetry">So, as we walk our earthly round,<br />
Still may the echo of that sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be in our memory stored<br />
&ldquo;Christians! behold your happy state:<br />
Christ is in these, who round you wait;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make much of your dear Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Purification.</h3>

The secret of the Lord is theirs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their soul is Christ&rsquo;s abode.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might mortal thought
presume<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To guess an angel&rsquo;s lay,<br />
Such are the notes that echo through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The courts of Heaven to-day.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the triumphal hymns<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; On Sion&rsquo;s Prince that wait,<br />
In high procession passing on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards His temple-gate.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give ear, ye kings&mdash;bow
down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye rulers of the earth&mdash;<br />
This, this is He: your Priest by grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your God and King by birth.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pomp of earthly guards<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Attends with sword and spear,<br />
And all-defying, dauntless look,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their monarch&rsquo;s way to clear;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet are there more with
Him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than all that are with you&mdash;<br />
The armies of the highest Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All righteous, good, and true.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spotless their robes and
pure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dipped in the sea of light,<br />
That hides the unapproach&egrave;d shrine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From men&rsquo;s and angels&rsquo; sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His throne, thy bosom
blest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O mother undefiled&mdash;<br />
That throne, if aught beneath the skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beseems the sinless child.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in high thoughts,
&ldquo;whose son<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wondrous Babe might prove,&rdquo;<br />
Her guileless husband walks beside,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bearing the hallowed dove;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet emblem of His vow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, on this happy day,<br />
His dove-like soul&mdash;best sacrifice&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did on God&rsquo;s altar lay.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who is he, by years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowed, but erect in heart,<br />
Whose prayers are struggling with his tears?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord, let me now depart.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now hath Thy servant

&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy saving health, O Lord;<br />
&rsquo;Tis time that I depart in peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Thy word.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet swells this pomp: one
more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes forth to bless her God;<br />
Full fourscore years, meek widow, she<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heaven-ward way hath troth.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She who to earthly joys<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Glancing around his prison room&mdash;<br />
But &rsquo;tis a gleam of heavenly light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fills up all the ample gloom.</p>
<p class="poetry">The flame, that in a few short years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep through the chambers of the dead<br />
Shall pierce, and dry the fount of tears,<br />

<p class="poetry">Touched he upstarts&mdash;his chains
unbind&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through darksome vault, up massy stair,<br />
His dizzy, doubting footsteps wind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To freedom and cool moonlight air.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then all himself, all joy and calm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though for a while his hand forego,<br />
Just as it touched, the martyr&rsquo;s palm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He turns him to his task below;</p>
<p class="poetry">The pastoral staff, the keys of Heaven,<br />

<h3>St. James&rsquo;s Day.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Ye shall drink indeed of My cup, and be baptised
with the baptism that I am baptised with: but to sit on My right
hand, and on My left, is not Mine to give, but it shall be given
to them for whom it is prepared of My Father.&nbsp; <i>St.
Matthew</i> xx. 23.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Sit</span> down and take
thy fill of joy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At God&rsquo;s right hand, a bidden guest,<br />
Drink of the cup that cannot cloy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat of the bread that cannot waste.<br />
O great Apostle! rightly now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou readest all thy Saviour meant,<br />
What time His grave yet gentle brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In sweet reproof on thee was bent.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Seek ye to sit enthroned by me?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! ye know not what ye ask,<br />
The first in shame and agony,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lowest in the meanest task&mdash;<br />
This can ye be? and came ye drink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cup that I in tears must steep,<br />
Nor from the &rsquo;whelming waters shrink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That o&rsquo;er Me roll so dark and deep?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;We can&mdash;Thine are we, dearest
Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In glory and in agony,<br />
To do and suffer all Thy word;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only be Thou for ever nigh.&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Then be it so&mdash;My cup receive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of My woes baptismal taste:<br />
But for the crown, that angels weave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For those next Me in glory placed,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I give it not by partial love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But in My Father&rsquo;s book are writ<br />
What names on earth shall lowliest prove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That they in Heaven may highest sit.&rdquo;<br />
Take up the lesson, O my heart;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou Lord of meekness, write it there,<br />
Thine own meek self to me impart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy lofty hope, thy lowly prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">If ever on the mount with Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I seem to soar in vision bright,<br />
With thoughts of coming agony,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay Thou the too presumptuous flight:<br />
Gently along the vale of tears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead me from Tabor&rsquo;s sunbright steep,<br />
Let me not grudge a few short years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With thee t&rsquo;ward Heaven to walk and weep:</p>
<p class="poetry">Too happy, on my silent path,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If now and then allowed, with Thee<br />
Watching some placid holy death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy secret work of love to see;<br />
But, oh! most happy, should Thy call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy welcome call, at last be given&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Come where thou long hast storeth thy all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come see thy place prepared in Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poetry">Turn it, and it shall paint as true<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The soft green of the vernal earth,<br />
And each small flower of bashful hue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That closest hides its lowly birth.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; All eyes to dazzle and engage,</p>
<p class="poetry">The Son of God: and that indeed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We see Him as He is, we know,<br />
Since in the same bright glass we read<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The very life of things below.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Eye of God&rsquo;s word! where&rsquo;er we

<p class="poetry">Who that has felt thy glance of dread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thrill through his heart&rsquo;s remotest cells,<br

About his path, about his bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can doubt what spirit in thee dwells?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What word is this?&nbsp; Whence
know&rsquo;st thou me?&rdquo;<br />

To hear thee that deep mystery,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The knowledge of itself, impart.</p>
<p class="poetry">The veil is raised; who runs may read,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By its own light the truth is seen,<br />
And soon the Israelite indeed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bows down t&rsquo; adore the Nazarene.</p>
<p class="poetry">So did Nathanael, guileless man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At once, not shame-faced or afraid,<br />
Owning Him God, who so could scan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His musings in the lonely shade;</p>
<p class="poetry">In his own pleasant fig-tree&rsquo;s shade,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which by his household fountain grew,<br />
Where at noon-day his prayer he made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To know God better than he knew.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! happy hours of heavenward thought!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How richly crowned! how well improved!<br />
In musing o&rsquo;er the Law he taught,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In waiting for the Lord he loved.</p>
<p class="poetry">We must not mar with earthly praise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What God&rsquo;s approving word hath sealed:<br />
Enough, if might our feeble lays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take up the promise He revealed;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The child-like faith, that asks not
sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Waits not for wonder or for sign,<br />
Believes, because it loves, aright&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall see things greater, things divine.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Heaven to that gaze shall open wide,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And brightest angels to and fro<br />
On messages of love shall glide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twixt God above and Christ below.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So still the guileless man is blest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To him all crooked paths are straight,<br />
Him on his way to endless rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh, ever-growing strengths await.</p>
<p class="poetry">God&rsquo;s witnesses, a glorious host,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Compass him daily like a cloud;<br />
Martyrs and seers, the saved and lost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercies and judgments cry aloud.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet shall to him the still small voice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That first into his bosom found<br />
A way, and fixed his wavering choice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearest and dearest ever sound.</p>

grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That they who nearest stand<br />
Alway to God in Heaven, and see His face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go forth at His command,<br />
To wait around our path in weal or woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As erst upon our King,<br />
Set Thy baptismal seal upon our brow,<br />
And waft us heavenward with enfolding wing:</p>
<p class="poetry">Grant.&nbsp; Lord, that when around th&rsquo;
expiring world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our seraph guardians wait,<br />
While on her death-bed, ere to ruin hurled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She owns Thee, all too late,<br />
They to their charge may turn, and thankful see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy mark upon us still;<br />
Then all together rise, and reign with Thee,<br />
And all their holy joy o&rsquo;er contrite hearts fulfil!</p>

<p class="poetry">Cheerful as soaring lark, and mild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As evening blackbird&rsquo;s full-toned lay,<br />
When the relenting sun has smiled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright through a whole December day.</p>
<p class="poetry">These are the tones to brace and cheer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lonely watcher of the fold,<br />
When nights are dark, and foeman near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When visions fade and hearts grow cold.</p>
<p class="poetry">How timely then a comrade&rsquo;s song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes floating on the mountain air,<br />
And bids thee yet be bold and strong&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fancy may die, but Faith is there.</p>

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Why</span> blow&rsquo;st thou not, thou wintry
wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now every leaf is brown and
sere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And idly droops, to thee resigned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fading chaplet of the year?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet wears the pure a&euml;rial sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her summer veil, half drawn on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of silvery haze, and dark and still<br />
The shadows sleep on every slanting hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How quiet shows the woodland
scene!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each flower and tree, its duty
done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reposing in decay serene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like weary men when age is won,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such calm old age as conscience pure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And self-commanding hearts ensure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting their summons to the sky,<br />
Content to live, but not afraid to die.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure if our eyes were purged
to trace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s unseen armies hovering
round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We should behold by angels&rsquo; grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The four strong winds of Heaven
fast bound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their downward sweep a moment stayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On ocean cove and forest glade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the last flower of autumn shed<br />
Her funeral odours on her dying bed.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in Thine awful armoury,
Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lightnings of the
judgment-day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pause yet awhile, in mercy stored,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till willing hearts wear quite
away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their earthly stains; and spotless shine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On every brow in light divine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cross by angel hands impressed,<br />
The seal of glory won and pledge of promised</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little they dream, those
haughty souls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom empires own with bended
knee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What lowly fate their own controls,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together linked by Heaven&rsquo;s
decree;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As bloodhounds hush their baying wild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To wanton with some fearless child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So Famine waits, and War with greedy eyes,<br />
Till some repenting heart be ready for the skies.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think ye the spires that glow
so bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of yonder setting sun,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand by their own unshaken might?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No&mdash;where th&rsquo; upholding
grace is won,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We dare not ask, nor Heaven would tell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But sure from many a hidden dell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From many a rural nook unthought of there,<br />
Rises for that proud world the saints&rsquo; prevailing
prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On, Champions blest, in
Jesus&rsquo; name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Short be your strife, your triumph
full,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till every heart have caught your flame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, lightened of the
world&rsquo;s misrule,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye soar those elder saints to meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gathered long since at Jesus&rsquo; feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No world of passions to destroy,<br />
Your prayers and struggles o&rsquo;er, your task all praise and
joy.</p>
<h3>Holy Communion.</h3>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">God</span> of Mercy, God
of Might,<br />
How should pale sinners bear the sight,<br />
If, as Thy power in surely here,<br />
Thine open glory should appear?</p>
<p class="poetry">For now Thy people are allowed<br />
To scale the mount and pierce the cloud,<br />
And Faith may feed her eager view<br />
With wonders Sinai never knew.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fresh from th&rsquo; atoning sacrifice<br />
The world&rsquo;s Creator bleeding lies.<br />
That man, His foe, by whom He bled,<br />
May take Him for his daily bread.</p>
<p class="poetry">O agony of wavering thought<br />
When sinners first so near are brought!<br />
&ldquo;It is my Maker&mdash;dare I stay?<br />
My Saviour&mdash;dare I turn away?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus while the storm is high within<br />
&rsquo;Twixt love of Christ and fear of sin,<br />
Who can express the soothing charm,<br />
To feel Thy kind upholding arm,</p>
<p class="poetry">My mother Church? and hear thee tell<br />
Of a world lost, yet loved so well,<br />
That He, by whom the angels live,<br />
His only Son for her would give?</p>
<p class="poetry">And doubt we yet?&nbsp; Thou call&rsquo;st
again;<br />
A lower still, a sweeter strain;<br />
A voice from Mercy&rsquo;s inmost shrine,<br />
This very breath of Love divine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Whispering it says to each apart,<br />
&ldquo;Come unto Me, thou trembling heart;&rdquo;<br />
And we must hope, so sweet the tone,<br />
The precious words are all our own.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hear them, kind Saviour&mdash;hear Thy
Spouse<br />
Low at Thy feet renew her vows;<br />
Thine own dear promise she would plead<br />
For us her true though fallen seed.</p>
<p class="poetry">She pleads by all Thy mercies, told<br />
Thy chosen witnesses of old,<br />
Love&rsquo;s heralds sent to man forgiven,<br />
One from the Cross, and one from Heaven.</p>
<p class="poetry">This, of true penitents the chief,<br />
To the lost spirit brings relief,<br />
Lifting on high th&rsquo; ador&egrave;d Name:&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Sinners to save, Christ, Jesus came.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">That, dearest of Thy bosom Friends,<br />
Into the wavering heart descends:&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;What? fallen again? yet cheerful rise.<br />
Thine Intercessor never dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The eye of Faith, that waxes bright<br />
Each moment by thine altar&rsquo;s light,<br />
Sees them e&rsquo;en now: they still abide<br />
In mystery kneeling at our side:</p>
<p class="poetry">And with them every spirit blest,<br />
From realms of triumph or of rest,<br />
From Him who saw creation&rsquo;s morn,<br />
Of all Thine angels eldest born,</p>
<p class="poetry">To the poor babe, who died to-day,<br />
Take part in our thanksgiving lay,<br />
Watching the tearful joy and calm,<br />
While sinners taste Thine heavenly balm.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet awful hour! the only sound<br />
One gentle footstep gliding round,<br />
Offering by turns on Jesus&rsquo; part<br />
The Cross to every hand and heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">Refresh us, Lord, to hold it fast;<br />
And when Thy veil is drawn at last,<br />
Let us depart where shadows cease,<br />
With words of blessing and of peace.</p>
<h3>Holy Baptism.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Where</span> is it mothers
learn their love?&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In every Church a fountain springs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er which th&rsquo; Eternal
Dove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hovers out
softest wings.</p>
<p class="poetry">What sparkles in that lucid flood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is water, by gross mortals eyed:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But seen by Faith, &rsquo;tis
blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of a dear
Friend&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p class="poetry">A few calm words of faith and prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A few bright drops of holy dew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall work a wonder there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth&rsquo;s
charmers never knew.</p>
<p class="poetry">O happy arms, where cradled lies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ready for the Lord&rsquo;s embrace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That precious sacrifice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The darling of
His grace!</p>
<p class="poetry">Blest eyes, that see the smiling gleam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the slumbering features glow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the life-giving stream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Touches the
tender brow!</p>
<p class="poetry">Or when the holy cross is signed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the young soldier duly sworn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With true and fearless mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To serve the
Virgin-born.</p>
<p class="poetry">But happiest ye, who sealed and blest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to your arms your treasure take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Jesus&rsquo; mark
impressed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To nurse for
Jesus&rsquo; sake:</p>
<p class="poetry">To whom&mdash;as if in hallowed air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye knelt before some awful shrine&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His innocent gestures wear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A meaning half
divine:</p>
<p class="poetry">By whom Love&rsquo;s daily touch is seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In strengthening form and freshening hue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fixed brow serene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deep yet
eager view.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Who taught thy pure and even breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To come and go with such sweet grace?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whence thy reposing Faith,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though in our
frail embrace?</p>
<p class="poetry">O tender gem, and full of Heaven!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not in the twilight stars on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not in moist flowers at even<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See we our God
so nigh.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet one, make haste and know Him too,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine own adopting Father love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That like thine earliest dew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy dying sweets
may prove.</p>
<h3>Catechism.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Oh</span>! say not, dream
not, heavenly notes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To childish ears are vain,<br />
That the young mind at random floats,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cannot reach the strain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dim or unheard, the words may fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet the heaven-taught mind<br />
May learn the sacred air, and all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The harmony unwind.</p>
<p class="poetry">Was not our Lord a little child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Taught by degrees to pray,<br />
By father dear and mother mild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructed day by day?</p>
<p class="poetry">And loved He not of Heaven to talk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With children in His sight,<br />
To meet them in His daily walk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to His arms invite?</p>
<p class="poetry">What though around His throne of fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The everlasting chant<br />
Be wafted from the seraph choir<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In glory jubilant?</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet stoops He, ever pleased to mark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our rude essays of love,<br />
Faint as the pipe of wakening lark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heard by some twilight grove:</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet is He near us, to survey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These bright and ordered files,<br />
Like spring-flowers in their best array,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All silence and all smiles.</p>
<p class="poetry">Save that each little voice in turn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some glorious truth proclaims,<br />
What sages would have died to learn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now taught by cottage dames.</p>
<p class="poetry">And if some tones be false or low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What are all prayers beneath<br />
But cries of babes, that cannot know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Half the deep thought they breathe?</p>
<p class="poetry">In His own words we Christ adore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But angels, as we speak,<br />
Higher above our meaning soar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than we o&rsquo;er children weak:</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet His words mean more than they,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet He owns their praise:<br />
Why should we think, He turns away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From infants&rsquo; simple lays?</p>
<h3>Confirmation.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> shadow of
th&rsquo; Almighty&rsquo;s cloud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Calm on this tents of Israel lay,<br />
While drooping paused twelve banners proud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till He arise and lead this way.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then to the desert breeze unrolled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheerly the waving pennons fly,<br />
Lion or eagle&mdash;each bright fold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A lodestar to a warrior&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">So should Thy champions, ere this strife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By holy hands o&rsquo;ershadowed kneel,<br />
So, fearless for their charm&egrave;d life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear, to this end, Thy Spirit&rsquo;s seal.</p>
<p class="poetry">Steady and pure as stars that beam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In middle heaven, all mist above,<br />
Seen deepest in this frozen stream:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is their high courageous love.</p>
<p class="poetry">And soft as pure, and warm as bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They brood upon life&rsquo;s peaceful hour,<br />
As if the Dove that guides their flight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shook from her plumes a downy shower.</p>
<p class="poetry">Spirit of might and sweetness too!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now leading on the wars of God,<br />
Now to green isles of shade and dew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning the waste Thy people trod;</p>
<p class="poetry">Draw, Holy Ghost, Thy seven-fold veil<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Between us and the fires of youth;<br />
Breathe, Holy Ghost, Thy freshening gale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our fevered brow in age to soothe.</p>
<p class="poetry">And oft as sin and sorrow tire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This hallowed hour do Thou renew,<br />
When beckoned up the awful choir<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By pastoral hands, toward Thee we drew;</p>
<p class="poetry">When trembling at this sacred rail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We hid our eyes and held our breath,<br />
Felt Thee how strong, our hearts how frail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And longed to own Thee to the death.</p>
<p class="poetry">For ever on our souls be traced<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That blessing dear, that dove-like hand,<br />
A sheltering rock in Memory&rsquo;s waste,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er-shadowing all the weary land.</p>
<h3>Matrimony.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> is an awe in
mortals&rsquo; joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A deep mysterious fear<br />
Half of the heart will still employ,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if we drew too near<br />
To Eden&rsquo;s portal, and those fires<br />
That bicker round in wavy spires,<br />
Forbidding, to our frail desires,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What cost us once so dear.</p>
<p class="poetry">We cower before th&rsquo; heart-searching
eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In rapture as its pain;<br />
E&rsquo;en wedded Love, till Thou be nigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dares not believe her gain:<br />
Then in the air she fearless springs,<br />
The breath of Heaven beneath her wings,<br />
And leaves her woodnote wild, and sings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tuned and measured strain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ill fare the lay, though soft as dew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And free as air it fall,<br />
That, with Thine altar full in view,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy votaries would enthrall<br />
To a foul dream, of heathen night,<br />
Lifting her torch in Love&rsquo;s despite,<br />
And scaring with base wild-fire light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sacred nuptial hall.</p>
<p class="poetry">Far other strains, far other fires,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our marriage-offering grace;<br />
Welcome, all chaste and kind desires,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With even matron pace<br />
Approaching down this hallowed aisle!<br />
Where should ye seek Love&rsquo;s perfect smile,<br />
But where your prayers were learned erewhile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In her own native place?</p>
<p class="poetry">Where, but on His benignest brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who waits to bless you here?<br />
Living, he owned no nuptial vow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No bower to Fancy dear:<br />
Love&rsquo;s very self&mdash;for Him no need<br />
To nurse, on earth, the heavenly seed:<br />
Yet comfort in His eye we read<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For bridal joy and fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis He who clasps the marriage band,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fits the spousal ring,<br />
Then leaves ye kneeling, hand in hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of His stores to bring<br />
His Father&rsquo;s dearest blessing, shed<br />
Of old on Isaac&rsquo;s nuptial bed,<br />
Now on the board before ye spread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our all-bounteous King.</p>
<p class="poetry">All blessings of the breast and womb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Heaven and earth beneath,<br />
Of converse high, and sacred home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are yours, in life and death.<br />
Only kneel on, nor turn away<br />
From the pure shrine, where Christ to-day<br />
Will store each flower, ye duteous lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For an eternal wreath.</p>
<h3>Visitation and Communion of the Sick.</h3>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">Youth</span> and Joy,
your airy tread<br />
Too lightly springs by Sorrow&rsquo;s bed,<br />
Your keen eye-glances are too bright,<br />
Too restless for a sick man&rsquo;s sight.<br />
Farewell; for one short life we part:<br />
I rather woo the soothing art,<br />
Which only souls in sufferings tried<br />
Bear to their suffering brethren&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p class="poetry">Where may we learn that gentle spell?<br />
Mother of Martyrs, thou canst tell!<br />
Thou, who didst watch thy dying Spouse<br />
With pierc&egrave;d hands and bleeding brows,<br />
Whose tears from age to age are shed<br />
O&rsquo;er sainted sons untimely dead,<br />
If e&rsquo;er we charm a soul in pain,<br />
Thine is the key-note of our strain.</p>
<p class="poetry">How sweet with thee to lift the latch,<br />
Where Faith has kept her midnight watch,<br />
Smiling on woe: with thee to kneel,<br />
Where fixed, as if one prayer could heal,<br />
She listens, till her pale eye glow<br />
With joy, wild health can never know,<br />
And each calm feature, ere we read,<br />
Speaks, silently, thy glorious Creed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Such have I seen: and while they poured<br />
Their hearts in every contrite word,<br />
How have I rather longed to kneel<br />
And ask of them sweet pardon&rsquo;s seal;<br />
How blessed the heavenly music brought<br />
By thee to aid my faltering thought!<br />
&ldquo;Peace&rdquo; ere we kneel, and when we cease<br />
To pray, the farewell word is, &ldquo;Peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I came again: the place was bright<br />
&ldquo;With something of celestial light&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
A simple Altar by the bed<br />
For high Communion meetly spread,<br />
Chalice, and plate, and snowy vest.&mdash;<br />
We ate and drank: then calmly blest,<br />
All mourners, one with dying breath,<br />
We sate and talked of Jesus&rsquo; death.</p>
<p class="poetry">Once more I came: the silent room<br />
Was veiled in sadly-soothing gloom,<br />
And ready for her last abode<br />
The pale form like a lily showed,<br />
By Virgin fingers duly spread,<br />
And prized for love of summer fled.<br />
The light from those soft-smiling eyes<br />
Had fleeted to its parent skies.</p>
<p class="poetry">O soothe us, haunt us, night and day,<br />
Ye gentle Spirits far away,<br />
With whom we shared the cup of grace,<br />
Then parted; ye to Christ&rsquo;s embrace,<br />
We to this lonesome world again,<br />
Yet mindful of th&rsquo; unearthly strain<br />
Practised with you at Eden&rsquo;s door,<br />
To be sung on, where Angels soar,<br />
With blended voices evermore.</p>
<h3>Burial of the Dead.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on
her, and said unto her, Weep not.&nbsp; And He came and touched
the bier; and they that bare him stood still.&nbsp;&nbsp; And He
said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.&mdash;<i>St. Luke</i>
vii. 13, 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Who</span> says, the wan
autumnal soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beams with too faint a smile<br />
To light up nature&rsquo;s face again,<br />
And, though the year be on this wane,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With thoughts of spring the heart beguile?</p>
<p class="poetry">Waft him, thou soft September breeze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gently lay him down<br />
Within some circling woodland wall,<br />
Where bright leaves, reddening ere they fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wave gaily o&rsquo;er the waters brown.</p>
<p class="poetry">And let some graceful arch be there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With wreath&egrave;d mullions proud,<br />
With burnished ivy for its screen,<br />
And moss, that glows as fresh and green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As thought beneath an April cloud.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Who says the widow&rsquo;s heart must break,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The childless mother sink?&mdash;<br />
A kinder truer voice I hear,<br />
Which e&rsquo;en beside that mournful bier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whence parents&rsquo; eyes would hopeless
shrink,</p>
<p class="poetry">Bids weep no more&mdash;O heart bereft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How strange, to thee, that sound!<br />
A widow o&rsquo;er her only son,<br />
Feeling more bitterly alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For friends that press officious round.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet is the voice of comfort heard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Christ hath touched the bier&mdash;<br />
The bearers wait with wondering eye,<br />
The swelling bosom dares not sigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But all is still, &rsquo;twixt hope and fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">E&rsquo;en such an awful soothing calm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We sometimes see alight<br />
On Christian mourners, while they wait<br />
In silence, by some churchyard gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their summons to this holy rite.</p>
<p class="poetry">And such the tones of love, which break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stillness of that hour,<br />
Quelling th&rsquo; embittered spirit&rsquo;s strife&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;The Resurrection and the Life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I: believe, and die no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Unchanged that voice&mdash;and though not
yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dead sit up and speak,<br />
Answering its call; we gladlier rest<br />
Our darlings on earth&rsquo;s quiet breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And our hearts feel they must not break.</p>
<p class="poetry">Far better they should sleep awhile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the Church&rsquo;s shade,<br />
Nor wake, until new heaven, new earth,<br />
Meet for their new immortal birth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For their abiding-place be made,</p>
<p class="poetry">Than wander back to life, and lean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On our frail love once more.<br />
&rsquo;Tis sweet, as year by year we lose<br />
Friends out of sight, in faith to muse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How grows in Paradise our store.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then pass, ye mourners, cheerly on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through prayer unto the tomb,<br />
Still, as ye watch life&rsquo;s falling leaf,<br />
Gathering from every loss and grief<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope of new spring and endless home.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then cheerly to your work again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With hearts new-braced and set<br />
To run, untired, love&rsquo;s bless&egrave;d race.<br />
As meet for those, who face to face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the grave their Lord have met.</p>
<h3>Churching of Women.</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One known from
all the seraph band<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By softer voice, by smile and
wing<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
More exquisitely bland!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here let him speed: to-day this hallowed air<br />
Is fragrant with a mother&rsquo;s first and fondest prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only let
Heaven her fire impart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No richer
incense breathes on earth:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;A spouse with all a
daughter&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fresh from the perilous birth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the great Father lifts her pale glad eye,<br />
Like a reviving flower when storms are hushed on high.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, what a
treasure of sweet thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is here! what
hope and joy and love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in one tender bosom
brought,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the all-gracious Dove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To brood o&rsquo;er silently, and form for Heaven<br
/>
Each passionate wish and dream to dear affection given.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
fluttering heart, too keenly blest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would sicken,
but she leans on Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sees Thee by faith on Mary&rsquo;s
breast,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And breathes serene and free.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Slight tremblings only of her veil declare<br />
Soft answers duly whispered to each soothing prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are too
weak, when Thou dost bless,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To bear the
joy&mdash;help, Virgin-born!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Thine own mother&rsquo;s first
caress,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That waked Thy natal morn!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Help, by the unexpressive smile, that made<br />
A Heaven on earth around this couch where Thou wast laid.</p>
<h3>Commination.</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayers
are o&rsquo;er: why slumberest thou so long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou voice of
sacred song?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why swell&rsquo;st thou not, like
breeze from mountain cave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High o&rsquo;er
the echoing nave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This white-robed priest, as
otherwhile, to guide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to the
Altar&rsquo;s northern side?&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A mourner&rsquo;s tale of shame and sad decay<br />
Keeps back our glorious sacrifice to-day:</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
widow&rsquo;d Spouse of Christ: with ashes crown&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Christmas
robes unbound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lingers in the porch for grief
and fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping her
penance drear,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, is it nought to you? that idly
gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or coldly proud,
ye turn away?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But if her warning tears in vain be spent,<br />
Lo, to her altered eye this Law&rsquo;s stern fires are lent.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each awful
curse, that on Mount Ebal rang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peals with a
direr clang<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of that silver trump, whose
tones of old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgiveness only
told.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And who can blame the
mother&rsquo;s fond affright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sporting on
some giddy height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her infant sees, and springs with hurried hand<br />
To snatch the rover from the dangerous strand?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But surer
than all words the silent spell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (So Grecian
legends tell)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When to her bird, too early
&rsquo;scaped the nest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bares her
tender breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiling he turns and spreads his
little wing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There to glide
home, there safely cling.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So yearns our mother o&rsquo;er each truant son,<br
/>
So softly falls the lay in fear and wrath begun.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wayward and
spoiled she knows ye: the keen blast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That braced her
youth, is past:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rod of discipline, the robe of
shame&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bears them
in your name:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only return and love.&nbsp; But ye
perchance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are deeper
plunged in sorrow&rsquo;s trance:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your God forgives, but ye no comfort take<br />
Till ye have scourged the sins that in your conscience ache.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, heavy
laden soul! kneel down and hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy penance in
calm fear:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With thine own lips to sentence
all thy sin;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, by the
judge within<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolved, in thankful sacrifice to
part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever with
thy sullen heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor on remorseful thoughts to brood, and stain<br />
This glory of the Cross, forgiven and cheereth in vain.</p>
<h3>Forms of Prayer to be used at Sea.</h3>
<p class="poetry">When thou passest through the waters, I will be
with thee.&nbsp; <i>Isaiah</i> xliii. 2.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> shower of
moonlight falls as still and clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon this desert main<br />
As where sweet flowers some pastoral garden cheer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With fragrance after rain:<br />
The wild winds rustle in piping shrouds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the quivering trees:<br />
Like summer fields, beneath the shadowy clouds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The yielding waters darken in the breeze.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou too art here with thy soft inland
tones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother of our new birth;<br />
The lonely ocean learns thy orisons,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And loves thy sacred mirth:<br />
When storms are high, or when the fires of war<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come lightening round our
course,<br />
Thou breath&rsquo;st a note like music from afar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tempering rude hearts with calm angelic force.</p>
<p class="poetry">Far, far away, the homesick seaman&rsquo;s
hoard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy fragrant tokens live,<br />
Like flower-leaves in a previous volume stored,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To solace and relieve<br />
Some heart too weary of the restless world;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or like thy Sabbath Cross,<br />
That o&rsquo;er this brightening billow streams unfurled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever gale the labouring vessel toss.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, kindly soothing in high Victory&rsquo;s
hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or when a comrade dies,<br />
In whose sweet presence Sorrow dares not lower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor Expectation rise<br />
Too high for earth; what mother&rsquo;s heart could spare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the cold cheerless deep<br />
Her flower and hope? but Thou art with him there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pledge of the untired arm and eye that cannot
sleep:</p>
<p class="poetry">The eye that watches o&rsquo;er wild
Ocean&rsquo;s dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each in his coral cave,<br />
Fondly as if the green turf wrapt his head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast by his father&rsquo;s
grave,&mdash;<br />
One moment, and the seeds of life shall spring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the waste abyss,<br />
And happy warriors triumph with their King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In worlds without a sea, unchanging orbs of
bliss.</p>
<h3>Gunpowder Treason.</h3>
<blockquote><p>A thou hast testified of Me in Jerusalem, so must
thou bear witness also at Rome.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Acts</i> xxiii.
11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Beneath</span> the burning
eastern sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cross was raised at morn:<br />
The widowed Church to weep stood by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world, to hate and scorn.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, journeying westward, evermore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We know the lonely Spouse<br />
By the dear mark her Saviour bore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Traced on her patient brows.</p>
<p class="poetry">At Rome she wears it, as of old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon th&rsquo; accurs&egrave;d hill:<br />
By monarchs clad in gems and gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She goes a mourner still.</p>
<p class="poetry">She mourns that tender hearts should bend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before a meaner shrine,<br />
And upon Saint or Angel spend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The love that should be thine.</p>
<p class="poetry">By day and night her sorrows fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where miscreant hands and rude<br />
Have stained her pure ethereal pall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With many a martyr&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p class="poetry">And yearns not her parental heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear <i>their</i> secret sighs,<br />
Upon whose doubting way apart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bewildering shadows rise?</p>
<p class="poetry">Who to her side in peace would cling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But fear to wake, and find<br />
What they had deemed her genial wing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was Error&rsquo;s soothing blind.</p>
<p class="poetry">She treasures up each throbbing prayer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, trembler, come and pour<br />
Into her bosom all thy care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For she has balm in store.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her gentle teaching sweetly blends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With this clear light of Truth<br />
The a&euml;rial gleam that Fancy lends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To solemn thoughts in youth.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">If thou hast loved, in hours of gloom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To dream the dead are near,<br />
And people all the lonely room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With guardian spirits dear,</p>
<p class="poetry">Dream on the soothing dream at will:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lurid mist is o&rsquo;er,<br />
That showed the righteous suffering still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon th&rsquo; eternal shore.</p>
<p class="poetry">If with thy heart the strains accord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That on His altar-throne<br />
Highest exalt thy glorious Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet leave Him most thine own;</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, come to our Communion Feast:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There present, in the heart<br />
As in the hands, th&rsquo; eternal Priest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will His true self impart.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus, should thy soul misgiving turn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the enchanted air,<br />
Solace and warning thou mayst learn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From all that tempts thee there.</p>
<p class="poetry">And, oh! by all the pangs and fears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraternal spirits know,<br />
When for an elder&rsquo;s shame the tears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of wakeful anguish flow,</p>
<p class="poetry">Speak gently of our sister&rsquo;s fall:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows but gentle love<br />
May win her at our patient call<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The surer way to prove?</p>
<h3>King Charles the Martyr.</h3>
<blockquote><p>This is thankworthy, if a man for conscience
toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.&nbsp; 1 <i>St.
Peter</i> ii. 19.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Praise</span> to our
pardoning God! though silent now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The thunders of the deep prophetic sky,<br />
Though in our sight no powers of darkness bow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before th&rsquo; Apostles&rsquo; glorious
company;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Martyrs&rsquo; noble army still is ours,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far in the North our fallen days have seen<br />
How in her woe this tenderest spirit towers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jesus&rsquo; sake in agony serene.</p>
<p class="poetry">Praise to our God! not cottage hearths
alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shades impervious to the proud world&rsquo;s
glare,<br />
Such witness yield; a monarch from his throne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Springs to his Cross and finds his glory there.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes: whereso&rsquo;er one trace of thee is
found,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the Sacred Land, the shadows fall:<br />
With beating hearts we roam the haunted ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lone battle-field, or crumbling prison hall.</p>
<p class="poetry">And there are aching solitary breasts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose widowed walk with thought of thee is
cheered<br />
Our own, our royal Saint: thy memory rests<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On many a prayer, the more for thee endeared.</p>
<p class="poetry">True son of our dear Mother, early taught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With her to worship and for her to die,<br />
Nursed in her aisles to more than kingly thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oft in her solemn hours we dream thee nigh.</p>
<p class="poetry">For thou didst love to trace her daily lore,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where we look for comfort or for calm,<br />
Over the self-same lines to bend, and pour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy heart with hers in some victorious psalm.</p>
<p class="poetry">And well did she thy loyal love repay;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all forsook, her Angels still were nigh,<br />
Chained and bereft, and on thy funeral way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Straight to the Cross she turned thy dying eye</p>
<p class="poetry">And yearly now, before the Martyrs&rsquo;
King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For thee she offers her maternal tears,<br />
Calls us, like thee, to His dear feet to cling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bury in His wounds our earthly fears.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Angels hear, and there is mirth in
Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fit prelude of the joy, when spirits won<br />
Like those to patient Faith, shall rise forgiven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And at their Saviour&rsquo;s knees thy bright
example own.</p>
<h3>The Restoration of the Royal Family.</h3>
<blockquote><p>And Barzillai said unto the King, How long have I
to live, that I should go up with the King unto Jerusalem?&nbsp;
2 <i>Samuel</i> xix. 34.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">As</span> when the Paschal
week is o&rsquo;er,<br />
Sleeps in the silent aisles no more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The breath of sacred song,<br />
But by the rising Saviour&rsquo;s light<br />
Awakened soars in airy flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or deepening rolls along;</p>
<p class="poetry">The while round altar, niche, and shrine,<br />
The funeral evergreens entwine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a dark brilliance cast,<br />
The brighter for their hues of gloom,<br />
Tokens of Him, who through the tomb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into high glory passed:</p>
<p class="poetry">Such were the lights and such the strains.<br
/>
When proudly streamed o&rsquo;er ocean plains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our own returning Cross;<br />
For with that triumph seemed to float<br />
Far on the breeze one dirge-like note<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of orphanhood and loss.</p>
<p class="poetry">Father and King, oh where art thou?<br />
A greener wreath adorns thy brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And clearer rays surround;<br />
O, for one hour of prayer like thine,<br />
To plead before th&rsquo; all-ruling shrine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Britain lost and found!</p>
<p class="poetry">And he, whose mild persuasive voice<br />
Taught us in trials to rejoice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most like a faithful dove,<br />
That by some ruined homestead builds,<br />
And pours to the forsaken fields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His wonted lay of love:</p>
<p class="poetry">Why comes he not to bear his part,<br />
To lift and guide th&rsquo; exulting heart?&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A hand that cannot spars<br />
Lies heavy on his gentle breast:<br />
We wish him health; he sighs for rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Heaven accepts the prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes, go in peace, dear placid spright,<br />
Ill spared; but would we store aright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy serious sweet farewell,<br />
We need not grudge thee to the skies,<br />
Sure after thee in time to rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With thee for ever dwell.</p>
<p class="poetry">Till then, whene&rsquo;er with duteous hand,<br
/>
Year after year, my native Land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her royal offering brings,<br />
Upon the Altar lays the Crown,<br />
And spreads her robes of old renown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the King of kings.</p>
<p class="poetry">Be some kind spirit, likest thine,<br />
Ever at hand, with airs divine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wandering heart to seize;<br />
Whispering, &ldquo;How long hast thou to live,<br />
That thou should&rsquo;st Hope or Fancy gave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To flowers or crowns like these?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Accession.</h3>
<blockquote><p>As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I
will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.&nbsp; <i>Joshua</i> i.
5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> voice that from
the glory came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To tell how Moses died unseen,<br />
And waken Joshua&rsquo;s spear of flame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To victory on the mountains green,<br />
Its trumpet tones are sounding still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kings or Parents pass away,<br />
They greet us with a cheering thrill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of power and comfort in decay.</p>
<p class="poetry">Behind thus soft bright summer cloud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That makes such haste to melt and die,<br />
Our wistful gaze is oft allowed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A glimpse of the unchanging sky:<br />
Let storm and darkness do their worst;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the lost dream the heart may ache,<br />
The heart may ache, but may not burst;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven will not leave thee nor forsake.</p>
<p class="poetry">One rock amid the weltering floods,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One torch in a tempestuous night,<br />
One changeless pine in fading woods:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is the thought of Love and Might,<br />
True Might and ever-present Love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When death is busy near the throne,<br />
Auth Sorrow her keen sting would prove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Monarchs orphaned and alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">In that lorn hour and desolate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who could endure a crown? but He,<br />
Who singly bore the world&rsquo;s sad weight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is near, to whisper, &ldquo;Lean on Me:<br />
Thy days of toil, thy nights of care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sad lonely dreams in crowded hall,<br />
Darkness within, while pageants glare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Around&mdash;the Cross supports them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, Promise of undying Love!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Monarchs seek thee for repose,<br />
Far in the nameless mountain cove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each pastoral heart thy bounty knows.<br />
Ye, who in place of shepherds true<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come trembling to their awful trust,<br />
Lo here the fountain to imbue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With strength and hope your feeble dust.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not upon Kings or Priests alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The power of that dear word is spent;<br />
It chants to all in softest tone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lowly lesson of Content:<br />
Heaven&rsquo;s light is poured on high and low;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To high and low Heaven&rsquo;s Angel spake;<br />
&ldquo;Resign thee to thy weal or woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I ne&rsquo;er will leave thee nor
forsake.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Ordination.</h3>
<blockquote><p>After this, the congregation shall be desired,
secretly in their prayers, to make their humble supplications to
God for all these things: for the which prayers there shall be
silence kept for a space.</p>
<p>After which shall be sung or said by the Bishop (the persons
to be ordained Priests all kneeling), &ldquo;Veni, Creator
Spiritus.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Rubric in the Office for Ordering of
Priests</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Twas</span> silence
in Thy temple, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When slowly through the hallowed air<br />
The spreading cloud of incense soared,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Charged with the breath of Israel&rsquo;s
prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas silence round Thy throne on
high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the last wondrous seal unclosed,<br />
And in this portals of the sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine armies awfully reposed.</p>
<p class="poetry">And this deep pause, that o&rsquo;er us now<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is hovering&mdash;comes it not of Thee?<br />
Is it not like a mother&rsquo;s vow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When, with her darling on her knee,</p>
<p class="poetry">She weighs and numbers o&rsquo;er and
o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love&rsquo;s treasure hid in her fond breast,<br />
To cull from that exhaustless store<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dearest blessing and the best?</p>
<p class="poetry">And where shall mother&rsquo;s bosom find,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all its deep love-learn&egrave;d skill,<br />
A prayer so sweetly to her mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As, in this sacred hour and still,</p>
<p class="poetry">Is wafted from the white-robed choir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere yet the pure high-breath&egrave;d lay,<br />
&ldquo;Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rise floating on its dove-like way.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when it comes, so deep and clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The strain, so soft the melting fall,<br />
It seems not to th&rsquo; entranc&egrave;d ear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than Thine own heart-cheering call.</p>
<p class="poetry">Spirit of Christ&mdash;Thine earnest given<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That these our prayers are heard, and they,<br />
Who grasp, this hour, the sword of Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall feel Thee on their weary way.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oft as at morn or soothing eve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the Holy Fount they lean,<br />
Their fading garland freshly weave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or fan them with Thine airs serene.</p>
<p class="poetry">Spirit of Light and Truth! to Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We trust them in that musing hour,<br />
Till they, with open heart and free.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Teach all Thy word in all its power.</p>
<p class="poetry">When foemen watch their tents by night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mists hang wide o&rsquo;er moor and fell,<br />
Spirit of Counsel and of Might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their pastoral warfare guide Thou well.</p>
<p class="poetry">And, oh! when worn and tired they sigh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With that more fearful war within,<br />
When Passion&rsquo;s storms are loud and high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And brooding o&rsquo;er remembered sin</p>
<p class="poetry">The heart dies down&mdash;oh, mightiest
then,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come ever true, come ever near,<br />
And wake their slumbering love again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirit of God&rsquo;s most holy Fear!</p>

paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
